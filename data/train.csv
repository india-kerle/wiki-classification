In a PR Opsens Inc. announced an order from BAE Systems for the supply of RadSens-type signal conditioners and OTG-R-type fiber optic temperature sensors. 
It follows recent approval of these products obtained from the [Defence Ordnance Safety Group] (DOSG), an organization of the UK [Ministry of Defence]. It did not specify what these are for, they could be engine monitoring of course.

 AI@50 

Thanks for the message on my Talk page.  No harm done, as I was offline of WP briefly at the time myself  and I learned a lot in the process of restoring and improving the article to WP Notability standards, a lesson I've applied elsewhere.  I also learned more about the WP distinction between Primary and Secondary sources.  The result is all to the good. I'll take your word that the oldprodfull  template is a good thing, though I think on first sight that the template's terse wording  """"This article was proposed for deletion by an editor in the past""""   could be clearer as to its intent: does this really suffice to, in your words, """"let future editors know that the article has already been through the proposed deletion process once and is no longer eligible for deletion without a proper discussion or other reason""""?  I hope so, though it was not obvious to me: it reads more like an invitation to agree or disagree to deletion and so reprise the issue.  If you can see it that way, as a relatively novice editor might, perhaps the oldprodfull template could be expanded to that effect, with some procedural directives and relevant links, to the original PROD and the policy guidelines for continuance.  I defer to your experience and good judgment. 

BTW, since you liked Kurzweil's other book, The Singularity is Near is certainly worth a skim  Moore's Law on steroids  a fascinating perspective, from AI's greatest optimist.

 The Burke Group 

In response,  I never provided where he went to school.   I added  he is a J.D.    RAther than delete he is a J.D. (Juris Doctor)  then refer to him as Dr.  David Burke?  A J.D. is a Doctor of Jurisprudence same as a Ph.D.   Why do you allow personal information that's good for you but not for others who might be interested in knowing more?  He was important enough to post an article so why do you think any reader will be satisfied with a sum total of data saying  he owns a rental property in Agoura Hills with a meaningless political contribution?  The property posted is a rental  where he no longer lives and maybe never did.   How is that useful in an article about organized labour? You said it yourself the article should be about the company.  But in actual fact, he IS the company.    He's a flight instructor whom I know from our FBO (Flight Base Operation).  Lots of people know him.   He hasn't contributed to Republicans for years.  Look at the site you  provided!!  Last one was 2004.  Why continue to keep outdated useless information?  The article cited by Dr. John Logan, a very learned fellow, contains some useful info but also contains factually incorrect information. Even he can make mistakes.   I am a lawyer and Logan is a British economist, and may understand E.U. law but does not understand U.S. labor law.  Just because he writes about it does not mean he understands it.  There is NO newspaper article about CDN that says employees were awarded from the Court of Appeals.  He wrote incorrectly.    The citation provided which corrects his article  is  from the court dockets.  Which is a better citation?    I provided the citation from  the law firm that WON the civil case against CDN!!   I removed nothing  about the case itself.... only corrected the information in such a way that the non legal lay person could understand the fundamental differences between NLRB law and DOL law and civil actions filed with the District Courts.   What John Logan wrote that you cite is liking saying someone was cited by the F.A.A. but tried at the D.M.V.!!!  Are you British?  F.A.A. is Federal Aviation Admin. and D.M.V. is Dept. of Motor Vehicles.  They are not related anymore than NLRB is to District Court or civil cases..   Burke works in NLRB jurisdiction and the case you cite is a Civil Action in District Courts not related.    If you want CDN  discussed,  first part is fine but the civil action is not.  there should be another topic developed in wikipedia for CDN.    Logan's article  used as a citation  lacks any credible legal citation connecting Burke to the civil case.   Only a legal citation should be used.   There are none available.    DJB is a very well known person and lots of lawyers both company and union know him. No matter which side of the aisle...this information is flawed.    If you are going to discuss legal issues then get them right.  Am I being picky?  Yes.  Inside the law you can't just throw something at the ceiling and hope it sticks.   Deleting FACTS for FICTION is beneath the dignity of what Wikipedia has strived to promote.    Why do you say the article contains everything anyone needs to know to justify deleting contributions?   How is that possible when Wikipedia is an opened forum for knowledgeable people to build and add more?  You think the sum total for the reader should be that Burke owns a rental property in Agoura HIlls?  How is that related to THe Burke Group?

I copy this from comfort women pages. It contains many references.

Why Korean comfort women during Korean War and why Korean collaborators? Because it is true. It all happened and it was all discuss probably before you were born. So we look to the academics and newspapers for reference.

From, The Construction of US Camptown Prostitution in South Korea: Transformation and Resistance by Lee, Na Young, 2006
 
'The term “comfort women” (wianbu) to refer to military prostitutes serving American soldiers signals the widespread acceptance of camptown prostitution as an inevitable means to entertain foreign soldiers. This term was commonly used in newspaper articles throughout the 1950s along with such phrases as “prostitutes catering to UN soldiers” and terms like yanggongju (Western princesses), or “UN madams” (woman getting a livelihood by serving UN soldiers).129 This usage continued during the 1960s and 1970s when camptown prostitution became more differentiated from non-U.S. military prostitution.  The Korean government’s policy on prostitution reflected its public’s perspectives on prostitution, which was, in the decades after the war, regarded as a necessary means to feed Korea’s impoverished population.'

The Chosun Ilbo or Daily News is major newspapers in South Korea 2,200,000 readers. Examples given are in Chosun Ilbo 23 August, 1960, it mentions, """"In Pup’yLng, some 150 'comfort women dealing with American troops'. Similar reports using the words """"comfort women"""" are: KyLnghyang Ilbo, 11/25/1955; Chosun ilbo, 11/08/1957; Chosun ilbo, 8/23/1960; Chosun ilbo, 12/03/1963. A “Comfort Women’s demonstration” is also reported in 1966. 

In the mid- to late-1960s, there were numerous articles in Chosun ilbo reporting crimes committed against camptown prostitutes by American soldiers that continued to used the term 'comfort women'. Korea college girls recruited for the Nangnang Club were also viewed as """"yanggongju"""" or comfort women (Seoul Sinmun 26 July, 1952; 10 October, 1953). Post-war military brothels were still known as comfort stations and the system based on the Japanese one.

In 1958, the Chosun ilbo also accounts for the number of women involved as 300,000. The women who served “one American husband” were called “yangbuin” (Western madam) instead of the usual """"yanggalbo"""" (western whore) who were generally treated by Korean society as “non-human beings”. Generally, the Yanggongju have been ignored in official Korean histories as a national shame until recent. 

Song-gun Chong in 1967 wrote, 3,000 so-called “comfort women” registered with the  Health Section of the Military and the Military Police Corps of the U.S. Army (“Current Situations of Korean Prostitutes and Countermeasures.” Pophak-nonchong 8:65-87.) 

You can download the main reference at http://www.lib.umd.edu/drum/bitstream/1903/4162/1/umi-umd-3959.pdf

References also arise in Yi, Imha. 2004a. The Korean War and Gende (Hankuk Chonjaengkwa Jaendo). Seoul: Sohaemunjip.

Have you seen The Women Outside: Korean Women and the U.S. Military. Directors J.T. Takagi and Hye Jung Park. 1995. 60 minutes. VHS?

Many of Korean women were also forced, tricked, financial compromised or even kidnapped into sexual slavery for American troops in South Korea. As example, the documentary features Yang Hyang Kim, who """"applied for a job in what she thought was a coffee house, only to be sold to a brothel outside Camp Stanley"""".

Same as Japanese Imperialists before them. They both documents how the Korean and American governments were involved, how Korean officials portrayed the women as “personal ambassadors” fulling their patriotic duty to nation by sexually servicing soldiers. The rape and murder of women by the pimps and the soldiers.

It says. """"Drawing upon interviews and testimonies, emphasize that many of the women who """"serve"""" the US military as so-called voluntary sex workers were in fact recruited in the same brutal ways as were their earlier counterparts in Japan's 'comfort system', that is, through coercion, trickery, and even force - because both Korean and American governmental interests have viewed men's access to female bodies for R & R as so crucial to military morale.""""

Demiurge has decided, apparently by fiat, that my link to a forum on the subject of Bangor is not allowed. He has attemped to explain this as being a commercial site (if it was I think it would be a damn sight better looking!) or a site of my personal creation. This latter is not only reliant on Demiurge's psychic powers to determine, but is also wrong.

I can see no reason to remove the link and leave the council one intact. I would prefer removal of both to removal of either. To leave one side of the story represented and not the other is censorship, no matter what rationalisation Demiurge tries to place on it. There is a great deal of unhappiness in Bangor at the moment about the council's actions and accountability. It is not material which could be covered in a NPOV entry but I believe it certainly deserves a simple link to enable those people who are interested in the town to see that there is a forum for their grievances.

This is all the more important since the local newpaper has been threatened with legal action by officers of the council for even printing the URL which I have linked in. Thus, there is a real freedom of speech issue here. I have not attempted to force this view into the article, part of which I wrote as well as taking and gifting one of the photographs for, but instead simply placed a link in the place put aside for links to Bangor-related sites.

I require that some better defence of the removal of that link than Demiurge's personal opinion be presented. If it is not, then I will simply keep adding it via proxies for the forseeable future.",0,0

Converses, they are amazing. if you are """"gangsta"""" they do wonders for you <3

When the U.S. entered World War II in 1941, Converse shifted production to manufacturing rubberized footwear, outerwear, and protective suits for the military. Widely popular during the 1950s and 1960s, Converse promoted a distinctly American image with its Converse Yearbook. Artist Charles Kerins created cover art that celebrated Converse's role in the lives of high school and college athletes.
Converse Jack Purcells

Through its shoes, Converse developed into an iconic brand, and came to be seen as the essential sports shoe. In the 1970s, Converse purchased the trademark rights to Jack Purcell sneakers from B.F. Goodrich.[2]

Converse lost much of its apparent near-monopoly from the 1970s onward, with the surge of new competitors, including Puma and Adidas, then Nike, Inc.Nike, then a decade later Reebok, who introduced radical new designs to the market. Converse found themselves no longer the official shoe of the National Basketball Association, a title they had relished for many years. While being employed at Converse, one of its employees, Jim Labadini (1968-78), created the chevron and star insignia / logo that still remains on most Converse footwear items that are not classic Chuck Taylors.

The loss of market share, combined with poor business decisions, forced Converse to file for bankruptcy on January 22, 2001. In April 2001, Footwear Acquisitions, led by Mardsen Cason and Bill Simon, purchased the brand from bankruptcy and added industry partners Jack Boys, Jim Stroesser, Lisa Kempa, and David Maddocks to lead the turnaround of America's Original Sports Company.

The new team drove Converse from the 16th largest footwear company to number 7 in less than 2 1/2 years, leading to a buyout by rival Nike on July 9, 2003 for $305 million, qualifying as the merger and acquisition of the year in 2003.[3]

Current NBA players wearing Converse include Kyle Korver, Maurice Evans, Udonis Haslem, Elton Brand, Louis Williams, Larry Sanders, Luke Harangody, and Chris Andersen. """"Big Baby"""" Glen Davis wore Converse mainly for away games for 2011-2012 while also wearing Nike for some home games. JJ Barea and Kirk Hinrich were former long-time endorsers who switched to Nike during the course of the 2011-2012 season.
Converse skateboarding

Converse launched its skateboarding program in 2009 with a team of """"ambassadors"""": Anthony Pappalardo, Nick Trapasso, Sammy Baca, Ethan Fowler, Raymond Molina, and Rune Glifberg.[4]

In 2012, the company added Jason Jessee and Mike Anderson to its ambassadors team.[5]

Chuck Taylor All Star basketball shoe
Red Chuck Taylor All Star basketball shoe
For more details on this topic, see Chuck Taylor All Star.

The Chuck Taylor All Star shoe has developed a number of nicknames over the years, such as: """"Cons"""", """"Connies"""", """"Convics"""", """"Convos"""", """"Verses"""", """"Chuckers"""", """"Chucks"""", """"Converse"""", """"Chuckalos"""", """"Chuckies"""", """"Chuck Ts"""", or """"Chucker Boots"""" or """"Chuck Taylors"""" for the higher styles.[citation needed] For decades the Chuck Taylor All Star basketball shoe only came in black, with a white variant released in 1947. Under pressure from basketball teams Converse decided in 1966 to manufacture other colors. Different materials also began to be used, starting in the 1970s, including leather, suede and vinyl, and even hemp, rather than just canvas. Besides high-tops, low-cuts and later knee-high versions were produced.
The Weapon
The Weapon, manufactured in many different color schemes

In 1986, Converse released """"The Weapon"""" basketball shoe. Manufactured in two color schemes to match the kit colors of basketball teams, it has been available in both high-top and low cut varieties. The unique aspect of this shoe is the leather construction throughout, including the inside heel which is also heavily padded for comfort. Converse re-released """"The Weapon"""" classic (which Kobe Bryant wore at least three times in 2002 and Andre Miller wore numerous times in 2002 from mid August to early September) several times from 2001-2003 and after, """"The Loaded Weapon"""" in 2003, """"The Weapon 86"""" in 2008, and """"The Weapon EVO"""" in 2009.

The first endorsers of """"The Weapon"""" were Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, who were prominently featured in a Converse commercial set in Bird's hometown of French Lick, Indiana in 1986. They were also worn by Axl Rose in the Guns N' Roses music video """"Estranged"""".

There is little """"positive"""" about your contributions Peter, nor your hateful comments Jim. People can read, and I don't consider either of you honest """"scholars"""" or editors. Your own words, and your edits are being scrutinized. So is your lack of good faith, among other failures to be balanced, kind, and true to history. So, keep up the very bad work on Nostradamus that both of you continue to do such as proclaiming that he is not an astrologer. Even a child who has read anything about the author of Les Propheties knows Michel Nostradamus was an astrologer - except, Peter Lemesurier, and Jiim62sch - who profess to be the KEY to all things known about Nostradamus, but who cannot even read a simple horoscope, nor chart of the celestial bodies. Perhaps this accounts for your bad translations, and even worse biographical """"knowledge"""" of Nostradamus, of course, called an astrophile because he practiced astrology as a """"hobby."""" Great work PL, but it doesn't hold water. Word has been out on Peter Lemesurier for years about his lack of astrological knowledge, and even less on Nostradamus, and most scholars avoid his work because of the errors, and poor scholarship to boot. This reflects even on the German-version of Nostradamus which PL has """"edited."""" One of the worst cases of scholarship on an encyclopedia on this subject; which is why he keeps putting out numerous books on Nostradamus. Why is this? Is not one enough since he knows so much?

It's a rather typical obfuscation tehnique. By accusing every person who posts something that makes an edit to his work, he then marks them as a bad user.

My Reply
Rjecina, calm down. Please, read my postings carefully, I have never said that Vlahs did not exist. Your comments are ludacris and off topic.  

Zenanarh, thanks for the reply. I have read the link that you have posted about the term vlah. The website is called """"G-d, Bosnia and Bosniaks"""", so i took all of the information describing Serbs with a grain of salt. I did enjoy reading the article, it  definietly had a lot of information that could be incorporated into the article (if there is another source backing it up). I have two major concerns. Firstly, the article concentrates on the Bosnian side Vlah's and not the Croatian side (the article is Serbs of Croatia not Serbs of Bosnia). Secondly, the article concludes with """"...when one hears... Russian politicians talking about the need to defend their ancient Slav brothers in Bosnia, that the one component of the Bosnian population which has a large and identifiable element of non-Slav ancestry is the Bosnian Serbs."""" I do not know how accurate the article is because of the last statement (in my opinion it leans towards the Muslim side). Also, inside the article there is a mention that Serbian scholars identify the term Vlah with shepards. Irrespectively, I think the article link was a great contribution.

After reading the article, the Bosnian Vlah's were """"settled"""" by Ottomans. Conversely, Croatian side Vlah's """"escaped"""" Ottoman prosecution. This was a mistake in """"Serbs of Croatia"""" article, which stated that Vlah's were settled by the Ottomans in Croatia.""",0,0

The days loses were as already given. Specifically Spitfire claims were not discussed, so the Spitfire's percentage of the kill total is unknown, which is conveyed in the article.

More importantly, citations have been given for for the Order of Battle figures. Your lack of understanding of how any historian presents his work work is palpable. OOB are given in lists, as you should know, so your """"give me a quote"""" tone is rather silly. Caldwell makes it quit clear that these lists are incomplete with regard to strength returns given. He gives known strength returns. As for Total German day fighter strength, again this estimated by Caldwell (as strength returns for all 6 years are obviously incomplete). He points out, and totally refutes your claim that the bulk of these machines were deployed against the oilfields in September 1944. 
1,000 in the defence of central Europe were available for operations at this time, while 1,800 alone were available for combat in the west. German fighter units in Romania in September 1944 were mixed in with Eastern front units by June 1944, making it impossible to tell just how many fighters were operating in the """"oil"""" capacity at this time. Even considering that all E.F fighters were at some point deployed in Romania they only reach a combined total of 2,250 compared to a total of 1,800 plus 1,000 for the other two fronts (negating even the Med.

Well, , a) my RfA was divisive and I barely passed, b) I've only been a practicing admin for about 3 months and, most importantly, c) as a clerk, I can see how hard the arbitrators work and how challenging it is to come to agreement with such a large group (over a dozen) members spread out over many time zones. 
It's a time-consuming, rather thankless responsibility and just becoming an arbitrator makes one a target for types who are anti-authority. So, if I ever ran, it would have to be at a time when I could devote time to it. I was looking at the history of the committee and I don't think there has been a term without one or more retiring early.

Things are not this simple. There is much dispute over wheather the US succesfully installed a democracy, since the new government is becoming more and more authoritarian, candidates were banned from recent elections, there have been fraud claims during all 3 elections and many human rights violations have taken place. Also Iraq's status as a US ally (leave alone major US ally) is questionable, due to the strong ties to Iran of many leading Shi'a and Kurdish figures and the growth increasing influence of Muqtada al-Sadr's political party. Also the insurgency is far from quelled, although it's not as deadly as it was around 2006-2007, with at least 4,000 civilians, 900 security forces killed this year it is still one of the most deadly insurgencies on earth.  19:26, 4 January 2011",0,0

Answere:- No I have not supported lotsd of groups. I have only supported the CPW , AWP (formally known as the NCPA). I was never a member of the People's Think Tank Association plus the PTTA never had a president. Plus I have only ever been one person. And that person is Peter Watson. This nazi must have a lot of time on his hands to look for information on me. So I can only come up with only one conclusion and that is simply that this man has no social or sex life. So I can only say on thing """"go get a life man and get a women"""".

Peter was President of the """"People's Think Tank Association"""" based in Warwick, which he says """"split from the Communist Party of Australia just recently and they publish the Caller""""

Answere:- I was never the president of the PTTA. The PTTA was never ever created. The Caller was a fake news paper. As fare as I know it was only ever printed once by some nazi. Since the PTTA was never realy so how cna it split from the CPA. So many questions and not enough answeres. The man just doesn't have a life.

Peter was """"President of the New Communist Party of Australia"""" and """"Chairman of the Central Committee"""" (this is in his Communist International News)

Answere:- I was the president but not the had of the NCPA. I was the chairman of the central commitee. But as you might know the NCPA and the AWP are the same group. The AWP change its name to NCPA but change it's name back soon after remember you stupid nazi.

Peter was """"President of the Communist Party of Warwick""""

Answere:- Only for a short number of times in the hsitory fot he party that I was the presidnet of it.

Peter also says: """"the New Communist Party of Australia (NCPA) , The People Think Tank Association (PTTA) and the Communist Socialist Workers Front (CSWF) did dissolve and absorbed into the Australia First Party (AFP)"""".

Answere:- The Communist Socialist Worker's Front never ever was created and never was real. It just goes to show that nazis just makes things up to help them selvs. The PTTA was never real. If you are aksing why I made the CSWF and the PTTA up well it was just for fun.

Peter has also set up the """"Australian Worker's Party""""

Answere:- This nazi (FairDinkum) is a idiot. I have said this many times that it was started in april was a split from the CPW that changed it's name to NCPA than change it's name back to AWP when it was kicked out fo the AFP. Not only are nazis stupid like FairDinkum but they also don't listen.

I am a Communist and believe in Marxist-Leninism. I am not retarted. Plus I am not troubled person or retarted. I have never said in my life that I was the king of the Communists or the Nazis.

Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?

Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.  Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.

The second one, a red 5000, did however unintendedly accelerate when I was at an intersection, and almost caused me to get into a head-on collision as I was attempting a left hand turn. I was familiar with the news at the time regarding the unintended acceleration, and the fact that the pedals were close together, so I released my foot from what I thought were both pedals, looked down and placed my foot on the brake only, the engine kept racing, and due to my leg strength, I was able to control the 5000, but I can see how a weaker person caught unaware might not be able to control the car as the rpm's were past 5000. As it was, it still took about 10-20feet to control the Audi. If it didn't happen to me, I wouldn't have believed it. As it was happening I couldn't believe it. I find it degrading that this article tries to place the blame on the driver as there was a real dangerous issue plaguing some of their cars.

the ioth, and proceeded to the fouthward with a prefs of fail,
in purfuit of the enemy. On the I3th, when in lat. 39 30'
N., within a few leagues of the coaft, the Admiral fpoke a
veflel from London to New York ; and was informed by her,
that fhe had feen the French fquadron on the preceding day,
about a degree to the fouthward, and that it then confided of
eight fail of large fhips, three frigates, and a tender. This
intelligence raifed the fpirits of the Britifh tars. The Admiral
fleered the courfe, by which he thought it moft likely that he
fliould fall in with them  and that fame evening the wind increafed
to a gale from the N. W. ; this was extremely favourable
to the purfuit, and made the Vice-Admiral entertain
hopes, that he would be able to overtake the enemy's fquadron
before they entered the Chefapeak ; or, if practicable, to attack
them whilft at anchor there. On the i6th, the Iris frigate, at fix
in the morning, made the fignal for difcovering five ftrange fail
to the N. N. E. ; and foon after came within hail and informed
the Vice-Admiral, that they were large (hips and fleering for
the Capes of Virginia, and fuppofed them to be only about a
league diftant  on which, the Vice-Admiral prepared his
fquadron for battle, by making the fignal for a line of battle
ahead a cable's length afunder, on a wind, which was then
frefh ; and not doubting but the fhips feen were the French fquadron,
he made towards them with a prefs of fail. At this time
Cape Henry bore S. W. by W., diftant about fourteen leagues,
the wind at weft, the enemy's fleet bearing E. N. E., the
weather fo hazy that the line of the Britifh line could fcarcely
be difcerned. About eight o'clock, the wind veered to N. W.
by W., and foon after to N. by W., by which means the
enemy obtained the weather-gage ; and about this time feveral
of their fhips were difcovered to windward, manoeuvring to
form their line. At half an hour after eight, the Guadaloupe
frigate ranged under the Vice-Admiral's lee, and brought the
fame intelligence that the Iris had given  he ordered her to
make fail and to keep fight of the enemy. The haze appearing
to thicken, the Vice-Admiral ordered the Iris by fignal to
make fail ahead and keep fight of the enemy. The Britifh line
was by this time completed, formed, and clofe hauled on the
larboard tack. The headmoft fhips of the enemy's fquadron,
at twenty minutes after nine, tacked ; as did the reft in fucceflion,
and formed their line on the {larboard tack.f At
thirty-five minutes after nine, the weather being very fqually,
the Vice- Admiral made the fignal for his fquadron to form a
line of battle ahead, at two cable.5 length afunder ; and at a
quarter after ten, he made the fignal for the fquadron to tack,
the headmoft and weathermoft fhip firft, and gain the wind of
the enemy. A little before eleven o'clock, the headmoft fhip
of the French line tacked ; but one of their (hips having miffed
flays, the reft wore, and formed their line on the larboard tack.
At forty minutes after eleven, Vice- Admiral Arbuthnot made
the fignal for his fquadron to form the line at a cable's length
afunder ; and at twelve o'clock, there being a profpect of the
van of the Britifh line reaching the enemy, he made the fignal
for the fquadron to tack, the van firft, and for the van fhip continuing to lead on the other tack. At one o'clock, the enemy's fquadron, confifting of eight two-decked fhips, having completed their line of battle ahead, but being apprehenfive of the danger and inconvenience of engaging to windward, from the high fea and the weather fqually, the French Admiral about half an hour after one o'clock, made the fignal for his fquadron to wear, and form their line to the leeward of the Britifh line.
At two o'clock, the van of the Britifh fquadron wore in a line, and in a few minutes the Robuft, which was the leading fhip, bore down in the moil gallant manner and was warmly engaged with the enemy's van  the van and centre of the Britifk fquadron were all engaged by half paft two o'clock, and by three o'clock the French line was broke j their fhips began foo to wear and to form their line again, with their heads to the fouth-eaft.

I think that all of these directions is probably better than the current version, which could merit inclusion and consolidation of the disputed content in a way that gives it appropriate weight compared to other uses of gun control, and correctly attributes historical facts vs opinions regarding those facts. Between the 3? choices I think the generic """"Gun control for political purposes"""" is probably the best. The more narrow groupings above I think will be subject to contention over how to characterize the policies correctly. The war vs peace thing I think does not provide a lot of value in its organization, and would prevent the grouping of the jewish issue with the US jim crow issue, which I think are good compliments for each other (and would possibly allow for condensation (improving the WP:WEIGHT) of the content since much of the argument regarding the two sets of policies is similar and from similar sources).

============

Two aliens landed in the Arizona desert near a gas station that was closed for the night. They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, 'Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.'

The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.

The younger alien became angry at the lack of response.

The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you.'

The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response.

Annoyed by what he perceived to be the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said impatiently, 'Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Do not ignore us this way! Take us to your leader or I will fire!' 

The older alien again warned his comrade saying, 'You probably don't want to do that! I really don't think you should make him mad.'

'Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his weapon at the pump and opened fire. There was a huge explosion. A massive fireball roared towards them and blew the younger alien off his feet and deposited him a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.

Half an hour passed until he finally regained consciousness. Refocusing his three eyes, he straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head.

'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien. 'He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?'

The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you don't want to mess with a guy who can loop his penis over his shoulder and stick it in his ear.'

Here's what I find interesting about this thread. The structure of Wikipedia enables anyone to edit and source articles.  So, if someone feels something is missing from an article, they are free to edit in and source what they believe is missing.  Then, of course, their own edits are open to a challenge.  All I've seen here, and elsewhere are complaints and tagging about POV.  After a while, this is repetitive and just not productive. And of course, none of us work for anyone else at Wikipedia, no one gets to boss anyone around or intimidate anyone into writing for them.  No one here can force anyone else here to obey their will. If you have the courage of your convictions, write it and source it . Put up or shut up.  11:21",0,0

Your accusations are false and malicious. You hurl accusations to justify your attempt to enhance POV editing in the article. There has indeed been bullying on the article but it has been directed AT me, not by me. You are obviously looking at this is a very biased manner. You punish Wikid for making a joke about a swine that offended The Magnificent Clean-Keeper. Yet, you punish me when I complain about horrible words being directed at me, including the repeated use of the """"F"""" word by The Magnificent Clean-Keeper towards me. There has been a great deal of harassment directed towards me, yet you totally ignore it or never looked into it. Then you make the totally false charge that I  misused mediation. That is outrageous. The mediator turned out to have a srong bias. He could not fulfill the role of an impartial mediator, in my opinion. To say that rejecting a mediator who had openly expressed a strong bias is wrongful is just more bias on your part. I agree that Wikipedia is not an advocacy site, and that is the exact point I have tried to make. BOTH sides of the murder mystery need to be included but since you have blocked both editors on the same side and encouraged the others to remove ALL of our work, it will hardly be a surprise when this article reads like the prosecutor's brief. But to me the worst part is to see the condoning of abuse of a woman editor. That is so sickening it is beyond what I am willing to tolerate, even to try to help achieve NPOV in an article.   """,1,0

Oh, it's you again. No one is contesting that Soriano did receive the so-called award. My point is that the """"award"""" is not notable enough to merit mention in an encyclopedia article. Also, we are not talking about """"board of directors of websites"""". A website need not necessarily have a """"board of directors"""". Even you can create your own website without the need for officers. We are talking about this spurious Philippine Web Awards being completely anonymous, in contrast with authentic award-giving bodies who would always devulge their leadership to the public. The mention of the board of directors of the Nobel Prize was just meant to support this. Your problem is you are always confused about what is being discussed.

One night in an online coffee house, a self-ordained Zen Master named Moulton said to him, """"Go to the dilapidated mansion you will find at the URL which I have written down for you.  Do not speak to those who dwell there; you must remain silent until the Moonbeam's students arise.  Go to the large parlor on the right of the main hallway, sit in the lotus position on top of the rubble in the northeast corner, stand humbly in the corner, and meditate.""""

He did just as the Moultonic Zen Master instructed. His meditation was frequently interrupted by worries, anxieties, and the occasional Bombesin rush.  He worried whether or not the rest of the plumbing fixtures would tumble from the second floor toilet to join the pipes and other debris he was sitting on. He worried how would he know when Moonbeam's students arose for their next blogfest on Ethics in Journalism.  He worried about what the people who walked through the room said about him.  Man, I tell you, this guy had spilkes.

His worrying and meditation were disturbed when, as if in a test of his faith, courage, and personal integrity, Moulton's provocative responses fell from the upper stories onto him.  At that time two Wikipedia editors blithely sauntered into the scene.  The first asked the second who the man was sitting there was.  The second replied """"Some say he is a holy man. Others say he is a shithead."""" 

Hearing this, the troubled young man became enlightened, if only for a brief instant of cosmic time.

My stance of being a """"Proud Nintendo 3DS Owner"""" has absolutely nothing to do with me taking a neutral position or not in the discussed article. Or can't a video game journalist for example, not have his/her personal preferences and do unbiased journalism at the same time? As for the colour code, I advise you to read the entire conversation before going in to bold assumptions. Like I said in a previous post: """"Alright, this is getting out of control. You're getting this """"Yes/No template"""" thing all wrong, seriously. Someone at my talk page said the following: """"To use an extreme example: """"Does the console kill people?"""", the answer is """"No"""", which is a positive."""". So by your philosophy would you color it with green because it's a good thing? Wrong. No, consoles do not kill people and yes, it is POSITIVE, but this does not invalidate the fact that it still is something NEGATIVE related to the question. Even the the templates themselves have by default the green color for yes and the red color for no, and that must already  mean something by itself. The purpose of Wikipedia is objectivity, not subjectivity. But what the reader does with the information is entirely up to him. Which means that if he thinks that something positive/colored green is a negative thing for him, that's his problem. He can think whatever he wants of this information. I hope this clears things up."""". To sum it up: Yes=Affirmative=Green / No=Negative=Red, personal preferences don't come into account. Again, as for the Vita issue, this has already been discussed with other editors and there has been reached a consensus in the following page: .

Vandalism Manifesto. Pass to all Wikians

VANDALISM IS GOOD. Vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm.
Vandals do their thing all over Wiki, 24/7, from frustration and hatred, 
because incompetent """"editors"""" who have no skills, no degrees, no expertise, usually no names, have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others.
Vandalism is a good and natural response to no-lifers (as in Get a Life) who 
do 7000 edits, 10,000 edits a year and who have actual Watch Lists of 1,300
or more and are proud of it. These jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized, over and over as long as they are in effect, vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop. Vandals keep no-life editors, admins, 
bureaucrats and stewards honest, or at least busy, reverting the reverts they get on their own pages. VANDALISM IS GOOD. It helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns. The Culture of Wikipedia is very,very sick,
and Vandals are needed to """"cull the herd"""". SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL VANDAL.

Sorry, I'm not. As you can read in the article for Palestine, the term """"Palestine"""" does derive from the Philistines, but it was given to the land by the Romans only in 135 AD, after the Jewish revolt. In the 20th century it was brought back to life by the British, and thus became recognized world wide as """"Palestine"""". In any case, the Philistines themselves were not present yet in the land in the year 4,000 BC - they arrived around the time of the Israelites/Jews, and they settled mostly in a relatively small strip along the coast, an area which is partly the Gaza strip.

Your references where all linked to the company, no independent sources. The claim that would make it notable, the number of downloads, has no independent verification.
it was written in a promotional tone. Articles must be neutral and encyclopaedic. The list of features is entirely unsurced, and makes unsubstantiated claims like ''this is one of the most used features in APUS Launcher...

See also Wikipedia:Best practices for editors with conflicts of interest.

 The nature of your edits also gives the impression you have a financial stake in promoting a topic. Paid advocacy is a category of conflict of interest (COI) editing that involves being compensated by a person, group, company or organization to use Wikipedia to promote their interests. Paid advocacy is prohibited by our policies on neutral point of view and what Wikipedia is not, and is an especially egregious type of COI; the Wikimedia Foundation regards it as a black hat practice.Paid advocates are very strongly discouraged from direct article editing, and should instead propose changes on the talk page of the article in question if an article exists, and if it does not, from attempting to write an article at all. At best, any proposed article creation should be submitted through the articles for creation process, rather than directly.Regardless, if you are receiving or expect to receive compensation for your edits, you are required by the Wikimedia Terms of Use to disclose your employer, client and affiliation.

WP:OVERLINKING policy on Wikipedia:Generally, a link should appear only once in an article, but if helpful for readers, links may be repeated in infoboxes, tables, image captions, footnotes, and at the first occurrence after the lead. If an article of 1,000 lines has a link repeated on line 600 there is no objection to keep te second link. A link repeated three times in the same paragraph is just plain overkill. Any undesirable future edits (removal of templates) should be adressed by closely monitoring your watchlist, not placing an excessive amount of duplicate links.
 ...is to keep everything in a format that is uniform with everything... In my opinion, that's just impossible. Imperial versus metric, inch versus foot and inch, alphabetic versus historical order, etc. Using other units for Railgauge templates than its corresponding categories and article titles makes it harder to recognise a particular Railgauge when editing or reading text, especially for people accustomed to metric systems. When the list of track gauges, navbox track gauges, article titles and categories all mention 3ft 6in it is odd to use the devious 42in RailGauge template. Moreover, the Railgauge templates are only for conversion purposes and not intended for sorting lists by size or alphabet. Uniformity for the sake of uniformity serves no purpose.
Taking WP:NPOV, in particular WP:BALASPS in consideration, Rail transport in Disney Parks is not less or more significant than a randomly chosen rapid transit rail system, famous heritage railway, abandoned railway or extensively used common carrier railway. There are numerous other railways transporting huge numbers of passengers, preserving steam locomotives or having other notable features.

In the newish section of the article about naming, there is a sentence that states that some Swedish speaking Finns would prefer to be known as """"svenskspråkiga Finnar"""". I believe that is completely rubbish as use of such a term does not make sense in the Swedish language (especially in finlandssvenska) as finne/finnar refers specifically to a Finn or Finns who speak Finnish as their mother tongue.

 Political correctness will be the end of our world as we know it. This is sad that political correctness has come to this level. It is causing our society to reward failure and condone criminal behavior. This is sad. We might as well change the constitution and exclude freedom of speech. This is next. Truly sad. Truly sad, indeed. 

 Also, regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as, china is the reason why the US's economy is in the crapper, and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early 1980's.

Thanks for the reply – my biggest issue at the moment is whether to include """"sales figures"""" for earlier years... as far as I know, there were no published end of year sales figures before 1994, and the sales published at the time for 1994 to 1996 have since been discredited and revised, so are basically worthless. The figures currently quoted in the articles up to 1996 are usually """"estimates"""" that have been taken from various charts message boards, calculated by enthusiasts from officially published yearly sales figures per artist (i.e. sales could be made up of one or more singles or albums, and estimating what percentage of sales were assigned to each record). As these are completely unofficial and unverifiable, I am thinking to remove them altogether or at least add a note that all figures are unofficial and estimated. In any case I don't think most people are interested in how many records the 37th best selling album of 1987 sold that year – it makes more sense to me to concentrate efforts into keeping List of best-selling singles in the United Kingdom up to date.

Comment
I have stayed away from this discussion for a couple of days, minded to retire from Wikipedia.  I'll postpone that idea a while.  There is an important issue here.

Does anyone wonder why this page suddenly became the focus of attention?  From 2003 until July 17 2011 the length of this talk page grew to 17,726 bytes.  Since August 29 it has grown by 74,997 bytes (before this post).  Meanwhile the List of castles in Wales remains rather neglected, and there is no sign of new individual county pages of castles in England getting extra attention.

A glance up this talk page to see what was written here before August 29 2011 will reveal unfailingly polite discussion.  Here is a sample of what has been written recently:

""""The professional attitude towards the current article has been lost to ego...  As this is a shameful topic opened by Paravane...  Paravane, you are ignorant and I'm tired of your possessive behaviour, against ownership guidelines... Clearly you are not competent in terms of reasonably developing an article to support the wider community... This article is a sham - a bloated mess, with weak keys, many images, and shoddy management. You have done nothing in terms of AGF of those making edits, or suggestions and continue to pursue your own mis-guided approach... As for FLC - they wouldn't touch this with a barge pole... splitting... removes the current possessive ownership attitudes which haunt the article...""""

Two points in particular deserve consideration:
Some editors, faced with what appears very plainly to be a personal campaign against them, will opt to retire from Wikipedia, and especially if personal attacks are seen to achieve their purpose.
If reason is not the sole - or even the principal - mechanism of advancing a campaign, it cannot be depended upon that reason will ever be sufficient to counter it.  If the campaign is obsessive, every line of reasoning will be dismissed by every possible means, and the campaign may be carried for no better reason than its opponents weary of arguing. 
A practice of ignoring the breakdown of mutual respect, as a basis for cooperation in the community, can hardly fail to be damaging to Wikipedia.   """,0,0

ce8d297cf1d48a90,"joshbuddy, your editing leaves me gasping! Your Lead-in is not only void of verification; it also presents several outright false statements, and seriously misrepresents other items. 

1. The statement that “Jehovah's Witnesses teach that blood is sacred and must not be eaten or transfused whole” is grossly misleading because all Jehovah’s Witnesses do not teaching this and your statement implies all of them do. Hence this statement of yours misrepresents. 

2. The statement “This view was put forward by the second president of the Watchtower Joseph Franklin Rutherford” not only lacks verification, it is just plain false. Rutherford did not teach that blood per se was sacred, and he never condemned blood transfusion. 

3. The statement “Beginning in 1980, the medical use of certain products derived from blood became permissible” is not verified, and it is just plain false. Watchtower doctrine tolerated some products derived from blood as early as November of 1961, which was only ten months after blood transfusion became a shunning offence. 

4. The statement “there is evidence that some Jehovah's Witnesses have secretly taken medical products derived from blood or blood transfusions” is a patent misrepresentation. Verifiable source material demonstrates that some Jehovah’s Witnesses have also openly accepted blood transfusion! 

5. The statement, “The non-acceptance of blood products by groups like the Jehovah's Witnesses has caused many hospitals to offer bloodless medicine” is another horrible misconstruction. When it comes to the Watchtower organization’s blood doctrine, there is no other similar group, and you have not referenced one either. 

Your statement manifests a serious lack of qualification to address this subject. You manifest ignorance of the subject, and a willingness to edit despite that lack. Hence I have reverted to the verified introduction, which feeds nicely into the article as a whole.

I cannot believe that people are so deluded to think that this guy Richard Kastle deserves a damn wikipedia page. 

Why not give every single person who plays piano a page of their own... HELL, why not let anyone just put up a page about themselves. Not only was he previously featured in a video DAMNING deceased pianists about their playing (accusing them of simplifying the ending octave section of Liszts 2nd Hungarian Rhapsody), but hasn't done anything to deserve any special credit. Apart from his compositions which truly aren't anything brilliant - in fact, they're almost bland and boring (from a compositional point of view), he seems to ride on the credit of having played two compositions brilliant (which seems to be the deluded, sick, biased opinion of a guy called MikeCaffey on YouTube) when in fact his playing is sloppy and usually completely drowned in pedal, completely disturbing the balance of sound in the music. 

Now this deluded, sick individual on YouTube (MikeCaffey) seems to go about praising Dick (short for Richard, and far more funny to refer him to that, than Richard) for his compositions, deleting valid posts by real pianists and piano players alike, possibly in an effort to sweeten the image of Dick to others. As a pianist myself, I can safely say that playing the end of Liszts Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 in c sharp minor brilliantly does not alleviate ones status to piano-god, and even if it did Dick STILL wouldn't be a piano God since he seems intent on drowning the ending with pedal, completely destroying the cleanliness of the parading octaves. 

Letting this slanderous leech of the musical world have a wikipedia page seems insulting to other pianists who truly have talent. Although they may not care whether they have a page or not, I find it insulting to the profession of pianism that Dick has a page of his own.

 Article 

Hi Craddock1. Please chill out and take a step back for a moment. I have considered blocking you for a bit to stop the disruption you are causing, but I feel a final plea is a better bet for now. On Wikipedia we have an important guideline of """"Comment on the content, not the editor"""". Your very first contribution to that AFD is to attack the nominator, and it has gone downhill from there. All you are really doing is undermining the AFD in a way which will not benefit you. Take a moment to step back, consider how you could marshal an argument to explain how the article meets Wikipedia's notability criteria, and continue with a reasoned explanation in the deletion discussion. Continuing with your current behaviour will end up with you being blocked. Errant (chat!) 

Hi Errant,

Thanks for your message and sorry if I seemed a bit frustrated,

It seems as if the nominator has tried to sabotage many articles on wikipedia talking to other admins and editors. The whole point is that the ADF should not even be there and yet it remains because the nominator has a 'higher standard within wikipedia' than me - which I find unfair.

If you read the comments in the AFD you will see they are mainly to keep or strong keep the article.

Nevertheless the nominator has tried to make things difficult by issuing a sockpuppet investigation despite me admitting my fault and promising not to do it again.

I hope you can close the AFD so we can move on.

Once again since i'm new to Wikipedia I hope you will not block me but please also see things from my point of view

Best,

Philip, London, UK""",0,0

Hj Mitchell, please spare us the dramatics of, """"I'll quite if you give me a reason."""" No one here thinks you will quite regardless of any reasons given nor would you be expected too. You are also fully aware that no one is going to mine through your edits looking for wrongdoing. That's just a waste of time and you would likely retort with they are NOTHERE. What I will do, is give you a few examples of what I have seen over a very short span of time. Given a review of any say, month long period, I think we will find the same result within a few percentage points of the mean.
You made an obviously bad call about Protonk, a well respected and long term contributor to this project based on what you term a BLP violation. You state in your comments that this was supported by other admins when anyone who takes the time to actually go there and read the comments will see, that no one supported your decision. This caused a moderate admin to leave the project completely only to allow less moderate admins like yourself more room to exert influence. After reviewing the comment Protonk made, I certainly agree it was a bad comment, but it was absolutely not worthy of a block without any sort of warning or talk page message and it was no worse than your outburst of telling all the editors in an RFA they are Fucking morons"""" because you were the submitter of the RFA and likely had your feelings hurt. An event I note that you were not blocked nor even approached about and as far I can find have never openly apologized for. Although there may be a comment somewhere I do admit. 
You have a tendency to exaggerate in your favor such as can be seen in the previous statement when determining that there was support to summarily block Protonk when there clearly was nt. This can also be seen in reviewing some of the cases on your talk page and talk archives.
As mentioned above, and as noted by several individuals, your Fucking morons''' comment is still too new and does not represent the attitude needed or wanted of a functionary.
You recently unblocked  and revoked his topic ban knowing this user had a long history of Personal attacks and trolling regarding gender topics and gamergate. Within 24 hours that user was again blocked for personal attacks, has continued to stir the pot and make drama and has been drug to at least ANI and Arbcom within the last week as can be seen on their talk page and the mentioned venues.
Even based on your comments here, you clearly have an attitude of knowing better than everyone else whats good for Wikipedia. That arrogance is inappropriate of a functionary.
You give a staggering number of over 13000 blocks and claim it as an achievement. Personally, I see this as proof of your tendency to block first and ask questions later. There is no way you scrutinized all those and I can easily see a lot of mistakes and preventing useful edits from being done through bad faith assumptions of guilt, similar to those you displayed towards me for criticizing your actions.

I apologize in advance for the length of this but I believe that it's necessary to include all of these details. I wrote a summary at the end so that administrator's could get an overview if they don't have time to read the whole statement.

I will be addressing the claim that I violated the 1RR rule in the second paragraph of this article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Shapira

According to WP:BLP, """"Biographies of living persons  must be written conservatively and with regard to a subject's privacy..."""" 
In a book written in a foreign language, with a lot of jargon, there are often competing translations/interpretations. And a book written in such a hotspot is sure to generate numerous quotes, misquotes, dubious translation and out-of-context statements. As per WP:BLP I think it stands to reason that a more conservative and less sensationalist translation be used, and for the same reason, the quotes should not be taken out of the context that the book uses them in.

With than in mind on the 18th of February, I improved certain parts of the paragraph in question in order to make to make it more compatible with WP:BLP based on this source.

user:Zero0000 -  responded to one of my edits by stating that [en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yitzchak_Ginsburgh&diff;=538816167&oldid;=538810305 I """"can't read.""""] And in what seemed to be extremely inappropriate comment for a Wikipedia administrator, told me in as many words to get off Wikipedia.""""Take a break"""" I didn't take nicely to being told that by an administrator and thus began a heated series of exchanges during which I was told by said individual that I had """"behavioral problems.""""
Said individual also decided to respond to my comments by invoking what seemed to me to intimidation tactics """"I started to write a complaint against you"""" (why do I need to know that? He can let me know when he posts it) and then later responding to another edit he didn't like by saying that """"it was on my charge sheet.""""

Now the reason I am writing about the behavior of said individual is to give some context or the 1RR issue:
After posting my version of the paragraph, user:Zero0000 subsequently changed it to this.

I will post only the first few words of his statement and the source:

Source: """"There is a reason to kill babies [on the enemy side""""]

user:Zero0000: [""""Babies [on the enemy side may be killed .""""]

After those first few words, user:Zero0000 continues quoting the rest of the paragraph. Now at best this is a serious distortion. 

And when you consider that article is dealing with a scholarly work which contains hundreds of sometimes competing, sometimes contradictory sources, rationales, theories, proposals, and ideas; many of which are subsequently discounted, limited in scope, or just tossed by the wayside, the disparity the statement """"may be done"""" and """"there is a reason"""" is even greater.

Aside from the distortion mentioned above, in contradiction to WP:BLP user:Zero0000 also opted for a particularly liberal out-of-context translation.

Why did user:Zero0000 replace my edit with his own. His statement:
(prefer source with an actual quotation)

As I showed above, he didn't use an actual quotation.

Furthermore, after seeing his comment, I searched but wasn't able to find any Wikipedia reference to a such a preference, leading me to believe that he was intent on just superimposing his own WP:JUSTDONTLIKEIT on me without explanation. 

His actions above combined with the general hostility cited above led me to be believe that this was another front in the multi-pronged campaign of intimidation that he was engaging in (i.e. encouraging me """"take a break"""").NEWLIN",0,0

 Condoning Bullying 

I have not really been around for weeks, indeed months, but I have been suffering regular harassment from Jbhunley, and you and others seem to be condoning his behaviour. It is never acceptable for someone to give another person unwanted attention for months on end.

 Many of the articles he nominates for deletion should be tagged, not deleted. Wikipedia needs improvement, not amputation.
 The number of my articles he has nominated is well up in double figures.
 He does not seem to read or research the articles he nominates properly.
 He does not have much or any knowledge about some of the thousands of articles he nominates.
 He seems to have no understanding that people have lives off Wikipedia. I cannot spend SIX HOURS dealing with one of his mistakes.

You seem to have little understanding of what """"personal abuse"""" is. Coming back after weeks, or even months, and finding someone is still trawling through my user history and leaving messages on my page - that is personal abuse.

Hi, I can see that you know more than a little bit about deletions so I want to get your opinion on something. The article Tony Grove is a single sentence which (I think) fails to assert notability per WP:BIO, and it seems doubtful the article could reasonably be expanded.

Hey, I like Milwaukee! 
First I'd do some quick google research on the guy, and if nothing came up, then give it a prod tag. If someone de-prods it and you still think he's NN, then go with AfD. Cheers!  talk

If it feels like home to you, then it must be...Home. I had already done the Google search as the first step; out of the first 50 hits I previewed only one mentioned the guy, and that was our article ) It seems like it's time for a prod. Very exciting, I've never done this before so, um...er...what do I do? 

In the article, add {{prod|Why you think it should be deleted}} at the top.  talk

fcc414f912c63849,"Amandajm: Ignorant Muslim & Disgusting Anti-white Racist
Reading back on racist, Amandajm - I've come to realize that in addition to his muslim name, he veritably hates white people. He deletes info about european history even if such info is based upon accurate inferences. Why he does this should be the subject of debate. My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim. Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european. Honestly, he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all. 'Stay on your side of the fence', is a motto I always quote.

To that, yesterday I followed up by sending emails to Homeland Security and the FBI Counter-terrorism Division for investigation into who he is and what his motives are. (No, I've not gone off the deep end). I received an automatic response email from the FBI stating that they will look into the matter, and will definitley be following up. Racist muslims of this type are tricky and can pose a risk to the US. Also, I sent an email to wiki complaining about this enemy of europeans and americans. I got an email back from wiki stating that he will be reviewed - thank god! His place in wiki - and in the US - shouldn't be secure.",1,0

The counterargument addresses the issue directly, and shows that """"Christ"""" is used in the Book of Mormon in the same way that Biblical scholars have interpreted the term. They have translated the relatively synonymous terms 'Khristós' and 'Messiah' into English, giving each a distinct usage. Joseph Smith seems to have followed the same patterns in translation, because the purpose of a translation is to convey the meaning of the base language, not to be overly literal. Obviously, the word """"Khristós"""" would not have been etched on the plates; the Nephites didn't speak Greek, just as they didn't speak French (see the end of the Book of Jacob). Joseph Smith chose to translate whichever word or character WAS written into the English word """"Christ,"""" because that is how """"Christ"""" is used in not only modern English, but in the English Bible itself.

 The Band's legacy, Beggar's Banquet, etc. 

An anonymous user is repeatedly misreading The Guardian source and insisting on adding a dubious tag to it.  Here's the direct quote:

The spark for Fairport taking this watershed turn was the Band's 1968 album Music from Big Pink, the record that - along with Bob Dylan and the Band's Basement Tapes bootleg - brought about a widespread musical volte-face, in which what remained of psychedelia was replaced by a new rootsiness. Among the rock aristocracy, its influence was evident in the Beatles' ill-fated back-to-basics project Let It Be, the Rolling Stones' purple patch that began with Beggars Banquet, and Eric Clapton's decision to call time on Cream.

The anonymous user takes issue with this statement, claiming that Music from Big Pink could not have influenced Beggar's Banquet because of chronology, i.e., that the Stones were almost done recording the album when Big Pink came out.  But, read the statement: it does not say that it influenced the recording of Banquet, but the """"purple patch that began with...,"""" etc.  This seems clear to me.  I would like to hear some other editor's opinions on this matter. -''''''TheFortyFive """,0,0

However, after I got to looking at NCdave's criticisms, and looked closer at the language and accuracy, I not only found 500-words, but like Dave, had to go above-and-beyond with additional comments. People like you and Dave (and Ruch Limbaugh) are my heroes for finding errors that are otherwise unnoticeable (and Wagon's not bad at this either, though his findings seem typically to sway more to the center or liberal left, in my opinion). Therefore, it is of high surprise that you couldn't find """"key issues,"""" either yourself, or those we've identified. (A folder of 500-word essays awaits you.) Likewise, when Uncle Ed was my own role model and example on how to solve a dispute, a method I successfully copied to be the """"great negotiator"""" and put out """"World War III"""" at the en.WikiQuotes.org """"Abortion"""" quotations weg page, it was likewise a surprise that Uncle Ed fancied himself the failure at negotiations, that had somewhat stalled: Talk:Terri_Schiavo/Mediation#Well.3F, """"It has been 4 days since the last contribution to this Mediation.

e67cb720b4ccd9b9,"Nature of the holdings in Mimms and Miller/“Police” vs. “peace officer” 

In carefully reviewing these cases, I cannot find support for the language I used several years ago, so I’ve revised it to strictly reflect what the Court actually said. Although the Court did not expressly require that a peace officer cite particularized concern for his safety, they did not expressly say that it was unnecessary, either.

The clarification of “federal law” is also important, because the Supreme Court, empowered under Article III of the US Constitution, cannot really grant “authority” to a peace officer; rather, they are limited to interpretation of laws and review for conformance with the Constitution, as they make quite clear in the citation from Mimms.

I’ve added a tag to the assertion that state law may not allow drivers or passengers to be ordered to exit the vehicle; though this assertion may be correct, it’s pretty sweeping, and needs support. It may be particularly significant in light of the Death of Sandra Bland. Many pundits have insisted that Ms. Bland’s failure to exit her car when so ordered provided cause for arrest, usually citing Mimms and Miller, and perhaps Texas Transportation Code §542.501. The Supreme Court holdings were of course limited to the Fourth Amendment, and did not (and could not) consider whether refusal to exit a vehicle after being so ordered violated state law; unless the Commerce Clause of Article I is somehow involved (and this seems unlikely), that would be a matter for state legislators to regulate, and state courts to interpret. Some states well may have done so; however, I have been unable to find anything close to dispositive, and have not seen anyone else do so. I am not going to make a project of running this down, but if someone else can provide this information, it would seem a great addition. Hopefully, any such reference would cite real decisional law that is unambiguous to the average reader, rather than a mere assertion by a third party (if the third party cannot cite authority, that party’s assertion is suspect).   

 “Police” vs. “peace officer” 
I do not understand the suggestion that “peace officer” or “law enforcement officer” is strictly the proper term needs support; I think the linked WP article makes it quite clear that either of these terms—which refer to a superset of “police officer”—are the strictly correct usage. I used “police” simply because in some other articles, other editors—usually IP—kept changing it to “police officer,” and the bickering seemed a poor use of time. And I reasoned that if the Supreme Court can use “police”—correctly or otherwise—we cannot be faulted for doing so here. Whoever added that tag did not give a reason; absent some good reason to keep it (or perhaps a suggested rewording of the note), I’m inclined to remove the tag.",0,0

 Recap 

I decided to withhold further comment until I had some sleep and time to critique the logic behind your deletion decision. I am delaying a trip this morning so that I can provide you with a response to your statement supporting deletion.

Your supporting statement for deletion is as follows: 

""""The result was Delete. The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm, and that the references do not support the notability of the subject. Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted. The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic, and I have counted those opinions as being from User:Julie Dancer. Kevin (talk) """"

As for """"The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm..."""" 
In reality the article title names a type of classification which arranges attributes in order of their significance.  Within the deletion discussion itself the calim is made by  at  that other algorithms exist, namely Examples of relevant works are """"A Fast, Bottom-Up Decision Tree Pruning Algorithm with Near-Optimal Generalization"""" and """"An Efficient Algorithm For Optimal Pruning Of Decision Trees"""". which are capable of performing the function the article title names:

If this is accurate then the right way to handle a necessary correction would be to add these algorithms to the article instead of nominating the article for deletion.

In anticipation of these other algorithms being added I immediately changed the body of the text to read """"The algorithm used for this purpose..."""" to """"One algorithm used for this purpose..."""" Since I do not now have access to the article's history as the result of your deletion I can not give you the exact date and time. However, it was prior to the end of the deletion discussion. (Incidentally, it has been suggested by a Professor at Cornell that deleting the article was for the purpose of eliminating the article history.)

Normally as a Wikipedia user I would expect other users who have an issue with such wording to correct it themselves as this is one reason the Wikipedia was setup this way. The Wikipedia still claims to be """"...the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.""""  

The impression I have now is that while there were an abundance of editors in the beginning who edited articles that there is now an abundance of spoiled children who expect articles to be perfect from the beginning or for someone else to edit them. They simply do not understand that each article is considered to be a work in progress and the Wikipedia being an opportunity to learn how to write and to edit rather than being completed. Instead of doing any work themselves they find it much easier to go around deleting articles which remain incomplete or have not yet reached a state of perfection, especially a maintenance edit like adding an inline reference that would require them to do any real work themselves. 

As for """"...references not supporting the notability of the subject"""" 
You can not logically make this statement without reading the reference or references first and you certainly can not follow this with a statement like """"Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted."""" All of the arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted in the text of the primary reference to which I deferred. Just as you saying that a stop light was green in a court of law when you did not look at the light would be a lie so would be claiming the reference did not support notability when you did not read it. I know you did not read the primary reference because all arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted by the both the primary reference and the references it contains.

As for """"The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic... 
This shows you did not read or comprehend the response I made in the deletion discussion or only scanned it. I explained that each of the user names were created so that I could track the use of my own resources better, similar to the need on the part of the Wikipedia to require bots to have their own user name even though several may be owned by the same user. Eventually at least one of my computes will be used to accommodate bots, but currently I am able to meet all of my needs by downloading the Wikipedia and mining it off line.

Since the existence of the alternate user names was stated and known by all from the beginning of the deletion discussion there is no w",0,0

 musings 

hey friday

while blocked the past two days i read through your subpages.   things like /admin etc.  they are great!

i'm burning out on this project  editing can be a lot of fun but in the recent past i've received so many hassles from editors following me around and admins interpreting policies liberally in order to block me.   i also saw that i'm not the only one who's been on the receiving end of this.   i've seen it all but its too long to go into here.  i'm not sure if these are new trends or just something i haven't spent the time to look into before.  

""""mere editors"""" really have little recourse in this.   filing arbitration proved exhausting for me in the past.   it required a huge amount of diff hunting and discussion for what seemed to me was a pretty obvious case of an out-of-line editor.   filing against an admin would, i assume, be much, much worse.   admins seem to behave like inner-city police with their wall of silence.

a lot of your comments show that you've noticed the same happenings.  in an ideal world i think you are right  people would behave reasonably...but i am pessimistic that will happen.   i have come to the conclusion that the only solution is to firm up wikis policies.   we need to define what something like """"disruption"""" is.   when someone is blocked for a personal attack, the diff should be included.   that a requirement for including evidence is controversial is evidence that it time for change; we've tried the """"trust admins to do what is right"""".   it has failed.

Hi. I've just noticed that you nominated this page in my userspace for deletion at MFD a couple months ago, and it was deleted. TBH, I don't remember what was there, and I was just curious if you remembered the topic (or how you came to notice it in my userspace in the first place). I'm not objecting to the deletion, although I'm kind of surprised that it was worth the trouble of deleting, and to find out that Wikipedia has a policy that allows for deleting of unfinished drafts in userspace (I mean, that seems ironic in light of all the total crap in article-space that I've tried to delete but that's been saved on the theory that maybe someday someone might possibly come along and turn it into something worthwhile). But, again, I'm not objecting or suggesting anything wrong took place, just wondering how it happened. Thanks for any light you can shed.",0,0

 Now, for those who won’t read, let me try once more. 

1.  Gwen Gale has dominated the article “Death of Adolf Hitler” for years.

2.  Gwen Gale is not informed about the “Death of Adolf Hitler”. She refuses to acknowledge the work of Sir Ian Kershaw, about who Wiki itself (no books needed) says “He is regarded by many as one of the world's leading experts on Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany and is particularly noted for his monumental biography of Hitler, which has been called """"soberly objective."""" . She continues to use Bezymenski, a 1968 admitted fraud, as a source over numerous other authors.

3.  Any time anyone will keep Gwen Gale away from “Death of Adolf Hitler”, serious scholars will fix it and get stars or whatever, Wiki will be accurate, and proud.

4.  Any time anyone will keep Gwen Gale away from “Death of Adolf Hitler”, I and all my posts become moot. All I have ever wanted was to get the “popular press” out of what I consider a serious subject.

For very well-known celebrities, the US government archives may have something: a Google image search on """"site:.gov"""" may bring something up.  Also, the search engine on the Archives website (http://www.archives.gov/) may find things that Google doesn't.  For people with military service, the military might have something (Google search on """"site:.mil"""").

For celebrities that were well-known before 1950, there may be newspaper photographs that have fallen out of copyright.  These will be hard to find, but the Library of Congress (http://www.loc.gov/) may have something.

A further option is to contact the celebrity's agent or estate and ask for an image to be released under GFDL, Creative Commons attribution, or Creative Commons sharealike-attribution licenses.

In my opinion, if free-use images can't be found, the second-best choice is a promotional photo: it's an image that is intended to be distributed widely.  Of course, there are exceptions: for albums, singles, and DVDs, a low-resolution scan of the cover is always appropriate.  For movies, a still from a well-known scene or a low-resolution scan of a promotional poster is good.  Failing all else, other fair-use images can be used, but they need to be tagged, justified, have the source/copyright owner credited, and used very sparingly.

As for the images at Iron Maiden, I'm still trying to figure out how strict I should be about fair-use images: all the images there are directly related to the subject of the article (except Image:PrisonerNovel.jpg, which I've just removed), all of them have some semblance of a source indicated, all of them have some semblance of a fair-use justification, and none of them seem to be surplus to the needs of the article.  I should probably push to have the justifications be made more explicit.  """,0,0

Taking this hypothetical Shakespeare scenario, it would tell us about his writing process, and perhaps a little of the politics of theatre in his era. Was it delayed because of writer's block? Were elements of the play changed from the way he envisaged/first drew it out because of that? How did it change the theme, climax, or emotion of the show? Was it delayed because the people in power (ie. the theatre owners) disagreed with the play he had created (imagine their reaction if it centred around a homosexual relationship back in that day!)? Or was it perhaps the actors who disagreed with the roles they had to take on? Again that leads us into how Shakespeare worked around the writing problems so that the play could, eventually, go forwards. Or perhaps he had financial issues and that delayed aspects of production. I am not a fan of Billy Shakespeare, but I would find any and all of that information to be most interesing. I would counter that it is, in fact, essential information for the article.

The fuck is going on here................ I don't even know if I should bother trying to fix this or just use my second account permanently. Shit, Indrian and Times probably playing some shit game here pretending to act like me and got all this shit on my page. I knew there was something wrong with those assholes when i saw them the first time. Guess I'll have to abandon this account. Hey  you still need to learn how to read links! Don't think I forgot! This isn't funny asshole! Guess what? I have been using another account and you don't even know what it is since the very first time I was blocked!

Oh and  don't think I forgot about your 5 year old temper issues when anyone tries and fixes issues with your precious Dreamcast punk ass bitch. Lol, you guys did a number on this account. Probably found out what program I was using for the first BS account you made. 

I am impressed with how much damage you have done to this account, but it really means nothing when I am still editing every day on my personal internet and you have no idea which account it is. Oh and no it's not using a proxy or a public wifi spot. Heck, I may even try reporting this, all you idiots did was use proxy's, if I post on this account on my personal connection, and THEN appeal this I might just get my account back and get you idiots banned. I know exactly what you are going to do after this to wait until I log off, and then pounce with a new account. Sadly, looking at all this crap in my talk page, an admin would have to be retarded to not see how many of these """"accounts"""" that are proxies and not actual connections. You can only hide the smell of rotten fish for awhile before someone notices.

Shit, may was well clean this shit up. 

Oh wait a second one more thing, , what kind of retarded admin are you when having a bunch of almost all accounts pretending to be me are all on proxies and not ONE of them acts like me (did you even see my history?), and not one uses a real connection? Got that brain damage you do. had to put that in bold to be clear. Warning me about an indefinite block, lol, what does that matter, you already screwed up noticing what a 5 year old would have noticed by now. Any person would be frustrated by the silliness of this nonsense. I would appeal but something tells me to much shit damage and retarded admins will make this impossible, and I would rather not use the IP of my other account (using a real connection n my personal internet) because then you guys will probably be jackass and deleted for fun, look at this page! All this shit and nothing clicked in your small head? Amazing wikipedia. 

Also I need to take note to stay away from low ranked video game pages and focus on popular until you guys get tired of the act.

Also I KNOW you guys got an account that is going to post a bit after I submit this post I SAW him and he did the EXACT same thing 3 of the duded did, you guys need help, I can't believe not one guy was not like """"this shit don't make sense"""" for a whole second. Amazing.

Alright, so clean this page and leave this message here. Erase other extra crap. Alright, looks like we are in business. BTW, I know this is probably bull, but if any of you two actually are not trolling, which is highly unlikely, than post request an admin to come by so I can clear this account up. But I have this sinking feeling you guys all knew what's been going on here this whole time, and I have no patience to search through tons of pages to find ONE contact I can talk to about this block, so you might have this account, but you won't get the other one.

Does it form compounds with any other elements?

Miscibility in solvents?
1) In addition H(1/n)2, where n is an integer > 1, representing the fractional state of a given hydrino pairing, it forms more complex compounds such as hydrino hydride crystals.
2) Hydrinos being a gas, there is no specific density it may have. Detecting the boiling point and melting point of hydrinos requires cyrogenic cooling or exotic pressures. The formation of hydrinos results in increased temperatures. It is unlikely that BLP will place measurement of boiling points and melting points ahead of understanding the catalytic processes which may form hydrinos in the first place.
3) High energy radiation
4) Miscibility is a property that occurs between two or more substances. Hydrinos, being a gas with an effective cross-section much less than ordinary than hydrogen, would be highly immiscible with most substances due to a much greater ease in passing through matter, in such a manner that it will easily escape into space.

Remember, this is a WikiPEDIA article, and NOT a dictionary definition or stub, so the thing, if anything, should be ADDED TO, and NOT taken away from. 

In other words, if you were to ELABORATE AND EXPAND on the article, I'd be your biggest fan probably, but it seems that 99% of the stuff you've done (on this article at least) is REMOVING REMOVING DELETING TAGGING TAGGING REMOVING SUPPRESSING ERASING GETTING RID OF REMOVING...and it gets a bit annoying and unnerving, that even WELL-SOURCED THINGS, like the Mormon matter, gets removed by you.    It was bad enough that you manuevered the removal about """"Anti-Catholic rejection of 'separated brethren' concept"""" cuz arguably it was not very well-sourced, but the Mormon thing (which IS a big thing in Roman Catholic positions and apologetics) to be obscured by you too?    Why?   If, as you say, you couldn't care less?    By the way, can you FINALLY tell me if you're male or female?   I've been curious, and also, I'd like to address you as """"sir"""" or """"ma'am"""", instead of some vague thing.....I have a feeling you're a woman, but I'm not sure...     Can you tell me maybe?

Sure.  Definitely get some of what content creation you want to done, as that'll 1. help with a future RfA and 2. ensure you actually do it; you'll find that admin tasks end up taking a pretty substantial percentage of your time.  You don't have to do everything (I've maintained some content work and uploaded a few images since becoming an admin), but a few articles will be helpful.  Going the NPP route to adminship requires a very high degree of accuracy; I've seen you in CAT:CSD a few times, and never had a problem, and from what I can see that's an accurate impression.  I'll have to check your AfD participation tomorrow when I get a better connection, but putting in a bit of time over there is also good.  Some dispute resolution participation is also a good idea; it doesn't necessarily have to be resolving the dispute, but something demonstrating you know some of the channels.  And in all those venues, make sure you watch how admins handle different situations; people may ask you questions on different scenarios, and it's good to have an idea of how you'd deal with them.
You won't need a huge amount of anti-vandal work, but a few AIV reports and vandal reverts are good.  And as to the RfA process; it's hard to predict.  The Blade of the Northern Lights|My RfA went about as smoothly as one could hope, but the RfA of another exceptional user was a lot rockier.

When diggers dug they have to organise the law and order themselves. Nearly every night robbers cut open tents and rob the diggers gold so, the diggers have to keep a pistol under their pillow. Diggers watched the people get punished and laugh at the robbers, one there's favourite punishments was putting on the robbers and then feathers on them. Diggers had to pay 30 shillings to dig gold.

Diggers usually found gold dust so they have to warm it up, so they kept it in a warm matchbox to melt it together. They kept guard dogs so they don't have to hide there gold. They would hand their gold to commissioner to keep it safe if they didn't have a guard dogs.

I imagine my edits will probably be reverted several times, so I may as well start this in case. Character articles describe characters, but they are not meant to hold every single plot detail relevant to the characters. Entries should have a basic description, background information if it is necessary, and plot details only if they deal with character development. Something like Doyle's development is fine to list, while random graphic novel appearances are unnecessary. Character lists also only deal with important characters. Minor characters are covered within plot summaries, and if people want to know more Wikia exists for that reason.",0,0

In popular culture
 Dunkleosteus was the main apex predator of the fifth most dangerous sea in Sea Monsters. The show counted down the top 7 most dangerous seas in history. Dunkleosteus was depicted as being cannibalistic and capable of bending metal.
 In the Dinotopia books and movies a massive Dunkleosteus dubbed the """"Fish"""" by the Kraabs', Lee and his son, Cyrus guards the underwater entrance to the subterranean caves that contain the strutters and sunstones.
 The Devonian predator also made a brief appearance in the video game ParaWorld.
 In the video game E.V.O. Search For Eden, Dunkleosteus appeared as an enemy creature in the first time period, and the player could evolve its jaws and body, both being the strongest in those categories.
 China Miéville's novel The Scar features Dunkleosteus, where they are also referred to as """"bonefish"""".
 In Ecco the Dolphin, Dunkleosteus appeared as an enemy in the prehistoric levels. Ironically the Dunkleosteus existed in the Devonian period and the prehistoric levels takes place 55 million years ago. They were already extinct during that time. Even its echolocation sprite resembles a shark.
 The early Playstation game Aquanaut's Holiday features at least two of these animals. One in the far north, within a 'den' and one in the extreme southeast.
 Dunkleosteus was featured in the second episode of Animal Armageddon.
 A Dunkleosteus is rumored to appear in the upcoming season 3 of the ITV television show """"Primeval""""

Really? Puny pictures in which you can almost not see what her eye color is. You need a magnifying glass to see her eyes. Don't show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate, which in your case makes sense. 1(By magnifying this image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green, not anywhere close to brown). 2(What the f*** is this? It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)

3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

JESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?

Your contributed article, Polyurethane foam
 Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, Polyurethane foam. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as yourself. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - Polyurethane. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will to continue helping improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at Polyurethane - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that they  userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia. Try not to be discouraged. Wikipedia looks forward to your future contributions.   """,0,0

Image copyright problem RE: Image:Wilno.PNG

 This image may be deleted.

Thanks for uploading Image:Wilno.PNG. The Wikimedia Foundation is very careful about the images included in Wikipedia because of copyright law. We need you to specify two things on the image description page:
 The copyright holder, and
 The copyright status

The copyright holder is usually the creator. If the creator was paid to make this image, then their employer may be the copyright holder. If several people collaborated, then there may be more than one copyright holder. If you created this image, then you are the copyright holder.

Because of the large number of images on Wikipedia, we've sorted them using image copyright tags. Just find the right tag corresponding to the copyright status of this image, and paste it onto the image description page like this: {{TAGHERE}}.  

There are 3 basic ways to licence an image on Wikipedia:
An open content licence
Public Domain
Fair Use

The copyright holder gets the best protection of their work by licencing it under an open content license such as the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike licence. If you have the express permission of the copyright holder to licence their work under the above licence, use the image copyright tag: . The GNU Free Documentation License is another option. Again, if you have the express permission of the copyright holder, use the tag .

The copyright holder can also release their work into the public domain. See here for examples.

Images from certain sources are automatically released into the public domain. This is true for the United States, where the Wikimedia servers are located. (See here  for images from the government of the USA and here for other governments.)  However, not all governments release their work into the public domain. One exception is the UK (see here for images from the UK government). Non-free licence governments are listed here. 

Also, in some cases, an image is copyrighted but allowed on Wikipedia because of fair use. To see a) if this image qualifies, and b) if so, how to tag it, see Wikipedia:Fair use.  

For more information, see Wikipedia:Image copyright tags. Please remember that untagged images are likely to be deleted.

If you have uploaded other images without including copyright tags, please go back and tag them. Also, please tag all images that you upload in the future.

If you have any questions, just leave a message on my talk page. Thanks again.  """,0,0

BBC did indeed release it's list of """"Top 100"""" based on 30,000 respondents. 

BBC's numerical """"rankings"""" of the 100 apparently weren't disclosed until, after the """"poll"""" was rather heavily flogged in a series of broadcasts, in which each of the """"Top 10"""" were advocated by various celebrities/authorities/commentators, and during which time a vastly larger number of """"voters"""" called in. 

I seem to remember the final number on order of 130,000. Whether or how this affected final rankings, is apparently unknown. Obviously these people were if nothing else, in some degree, TV fans.

The Wikipedia article seems to fully accept the validity of the BBC """"poll"""" (which was not at all focused on Scott). Further, the article implies (to me) that the poll revealed a decline, over time, in Scott's popularity with the British Public. 

Seems like a reasonable thesis, but without comparable """"polling"""" data from previous periods, this is not more than interesting speculation on the part of whatever author is cited.

For deep background, Wikipedia itself has a number of (non-featured) articles that are somewhat relevant with regard to the rather complex topic of polling, including sampling error margin of error,  tracking poll, straw poll, and various other topics. 
I'm certainly uninformed.

48a6c963fdfc9aad,""": Hi Hanely, and others,

First, a further clarification on the concept behind wikipedia, neutrality is a fundamental pillar, but there are two others as well, no original research and verifiability.  This takes us into the """"weasel words"""" you mention, which it's true is an area where improvements are needed with the article.  A reader should be able to independently check everything written in a wikipedia article should they want to, and as such, wikipedia is more about providing verifiable information rather than what a given editor simply thinks or believes is """"true.""""  You specifically cite the Criticism section, and I agree.  """"Plagiarism"""" has evolved the furthest of the three subsections IMO and is solidly referenced with verifiable sources (I think the believer stance(s) aren't presented as well as they could though), and the same should probably be done for """"Science"""" and """"Revelation"""".  For instance, one thing that can be done for """"Revelation"""" is cite the low book sales and distribution of the TUB instead of the simple current statement that it isn't widespread.  """"Peacock terms"""" have been an ongoing challenge from my perspective, commonly inserted throughout the article in a way that aggrandizes the book, but I think this is currently toned down.

What I'm hearing from you Hanely overall is a suggestion to focus on TUB alone, make the article perhaps a book summary with some history added, and put everything else in other articles.  It is one way to go, and you specifically mention Criticism-related topics as being placed elsewhere.  This would also need to be true of the adherents section and anything """"pro"""".  I don't agree with this tactic however, for reasons of wikipedia policy and overall usefulness to the average reader.  What makes TUB interesting and worth writing & reading about is that it purports to be more than a typical religious book, and people accept it as such.  I think that is a highly intertwined element of the TUB topic, and it fits in this article, and by the same token the reasons people *don't* accept it as such is part of the story.  I think it is a challenge to have the article reflect these differing perspectives, but that's a basic challenge involved with wikipedia articles in a nutshell.  Writing separate articles for separate points of view is discouraged.  See POV forking.

I think there needs to be a top-level article that is a summary of The Urantia Book basics, its teachings, its history, and those who are pro and con on topics related to it.  Other articles can then develop certain topics in more depth, if needed or wanted.  I don't see why the top-level article shouldn't be this one, it already serves as that, and other similar topics on wikipedia are structured the same way (for instance A Course in Miracles isn't a simple book synopsis & some words about the history, but covers pro and con viewpoints, as does Book of Mormon, which also has a plagiarism section).  I certainly do not accept that for some reason everything to do with Criticism should be tucked away in separate articles.  This is inherently biased toward the idea that the main wikipedia article is only for those seeking viewpoints where nothing negative is said.  Audiences also come to learn about contrary viewpoints, and those viewpoints are just as valid.

On the points you brought up, my thoughts:

1.  I've seen a tendency over the 1+ year I've followed this wikipedia article off and on for people to add many digressions to the article.  And understandably so, TUB is enormous and has thousands of interesting details and side stories.  But not all will fit in the main article.  I've seen multiple people each add a few sentences here and there, and over time, the article has become enormous and unfocused with all sorts of illogical disorganized digressions.  Like you say, this article can stand to be streamlined (you should have seen what it's been like before!).  IMO, the Lucifer rebellion story, while interesting, doesn't quite make the cut in terms of being essential enough to mention on the main page.  Perhaps an article summarizing TUB's view of the history of earth is worthwhile to build up?  The Lucifer / Caligastia / Satan story would fit in article such as that, for example.

2.-5.  Like I've said, Criticism is appropriate to have, as is the view of believers, and a POV fork is contrary to wikipedia standards.  In terms of Gardner specifically, despite any opinions on his conclusions about TUB, his book is one of the few published about TUB to analyze it from a nonbeliever perspective and it's entirely appropriate to use and cite as reference material for the article.  I say that even though I'm not personally convinced by arguments he makes.  I've read his book, have access to a copy, and can make edits regarding i",0,0

In response to the section below, if there were no Arab Jewish tribes, there are certainly Arab Jews. Despite the fact that many Jews in the Middle East left (or were encouraged to leave) during the 1950s and 60s to non-Arabic speaking countries, many still keep their identity as both Arabs and Jews. Continued pressure within the Jewish community to act more like the Eastern European-descendant Jews only means that it is all the more important to recognize Jewish people of Arab descent (and whose first language was often Arabic, then Hebrew) on this page. It would make sense to do so, however, with the caveat that some Arabic-speaking Jews identify both as Jews and as Arabs, while some do notjust as it's done for Christians from the Arab world on this page.

Any tank that has to maneuvre around at close range to the sides and rear of an opposing tank to score a kill is definitely not good. The only notable good Sherman at the end of the war is the VC Firefly, but because US Ordinance doubted the 17 pounder could be fitted onto the tank, it was manufactured in limited quantities. 

The only notable features of the Sherman was that it was produced in large quantities, had a mechanical reliability that beat the T-34, and came with better secondary equipment such as FM Radio and an elevation gyro-stabiliser.

Not to mention the extremely sad stories behind it. Once, a Sherman maneuvered around a building to hide from a Tiger tank. The Tiger shot at the building, and the shell went right through and penetrated the Sherman's turret. There are also tales of German tanks who take out two aligned Shermans in one shot. Also, do you know why you see all these wartime photos of crewmen who have Shermans with spare road wheels and tracks welded onto the hull?

And, for the record, NO, this is not a personal attack, just an observation on the total pointlessness of this entry...

Maybe we should all put our CV's on Wikipedia, but I thought that Wiki was attempting to become a credible medium of encyclopeadic information on the Internet, not for self-publicity seeking ego merchants to paste up their life story and that of their woefully un-spectacular personal and family histories.

This entire entry is no more suitable for a page than my life's contribution to the study of Ethiopian-styles of ballroom dancing. It belongs on a Wiki personal page and no more.

Considering that my family tree can be traced to before the Norman invasion of England and I hold an hereditary title (which was once owned by Elizabeth I and Francis Bacon) maybe I could start posting up my little life story and my g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-uncles and g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-grand-daddies and which castles they built, etc. (yawn)  But there again, I am not a vain, egotistical numpty who wants to use Wikipedia as an online CV service - I do wonder if the crypto-consultancy industry needs a few heads at the moment... Hmmmmmmmmmm.

(I only mention dear old Lizzie the First and Nick Bacon as they have actually been heard of by most people)... not becuase I wish to pump up my ego.  In fact, the title was grabbed by Liz after the Reformation, so it wasn't all that good news for us, after all... and certainly not something to be gloating about.

There are loads of unsubstantiated claims in this article, including stats about website hits compared to the CIA... oh yeah, come off it!! -D

I think the German Wikipedians have got it about right...  does not warrant inclusion.

Meanwhile, I'll carry on editing the 2-3 topics that I do know about (Templar History, aviation, and erm... maybe a bit of medieval history too) and I won't try to be all things to all people in offering my omnipotent edits on a variety of subjects that I only know a very little, unlike some of the people on here.  Maybe it's just an attempt to get edit counts ever higher to make oneself look incredibly intelligent and important. And then get supported by all our colleagues from work and our own self-created crypto-society members, etc. to come to our defence when we need them.

P.S. By the way, my mother's Scottish line is distantly related to Alan Bean, your esteemed astronaut who was the fourth man on the moon, but I don't hold it against him. A good chap.  -)

Hi, Rick Norwood. Funny but I find just the opposite to be true. Badly written edits, i.e. blatant attempts at removing meaning from articles, are mostly done by left-leaning (socialist, modern liberal, etc.) editors. Also, the large majority of editors, and not suprisingly, admins here at the wiki, are socialist and in general left-leaning and are dominating many of the political articles. The meaning of words, the correct charictarization of ideologies, and history itself, is being altered. This article is a prime example of this aricle take-over and the propaganda that is being strongly pushed here. I predict it will be the downfall of Wikipedia. This is sad to me because, what could have been a free and inclusive collaberation of knowledge, has been turned into a giant machine that spits out non-fact, censorship, and well, just plain propagandistic cow flop.

f1f6be4d12b468d2,"connection between 4chan and anonymous and anonymous culture 

I'm not sure the extended section on 4chan users is really necessary in this article.  Here's my formal sounding original reasoning that I thought started sounding too formal:

As it stands, the lines drawn between those three things are rather thin.  While Anonymous does profit from Anonymity, and 4chan users can profit from anonymity, I think there needs to be a more direct connection shown in this article before there needs to be an extended section upon 4chan within the article.  Consider it like this:

My father doesn't like potatoes.  Turnip eaters often don't like potatoes.  My father must eat turnips.
Anonymous profits from anonymity.  4chan users profit from anonymity.  Anonomous members must be 4chan members.

I don't doubt that there are many participants in Anonymous that use 4chan, I'm just not sure it is relevant to the point of extended discussion of Anonymous unless' there is proof that 4chan was the main location where Anonymous was organized.  There have been several sites akin to 4chan both preceding and following, and in addition IRC also served as a gathering place for anonymous individuals to share information collectively - including early hackers.  A discussion of 4chan as a subset of anonymous culture should be listed on cyberculture and 4chan and if necessary on a new page dedicated to anonymous(culture).  This article purports to be about Anonymous as a loosely associated hacktivist group - the focus, thus, should be on Anonymous(group)",0,0

I just said that is recognized by WWE as a title. 2)If you see the animation on the Million Dollar Championship history page on WWE.com you will see that the title was abandoned after Ted DiBiase reign. Abandoned = retired.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 187.15.89.67

The homepage of the Anarchist Internatonal, www.anarchy.no , is not nonsensensial. Try to prove it and you will fail. The article Anarchist International on Wikipedia is objective and to the point. 

The organizations/networks associated to the Anarchist International are found at the link-page of www.anarchy.no , and then there is a big network of networkmembers/subscribers related to the different organizations/networks.

As for Zazaban I have problems with taking him seriously. In a discussion on Anarchism.net he answered with the following """"intelligent"""" and a bit ochlarchical statements: 
""""You're one to talk. - And, just to see how you react; FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. FUCK FUCK. FUCK."""" Source . I would not put too much weight on what he means. I don't think such comments are funny.

Historical context behind Japanese occupation of Korea is crucial to understanding Karate's influence on the formation of TKD.  Huge parts of TKD culture, history, practice, personalities are heavily influenced by the repressive nature of the colonial period.  Omitting this context would be FACTUALLY misleading.  THis section is about Karate's influence on TKD.  MOST of this influence occurred during colonial times.  I don't see how you can leave out historical context of occupation.  

Dude, this section is about KARATE'S INFLUENCE ON TKD!  According to your logic the whole section needs to be deleted because it's about TKD and NOT karate.  You're not making sense here. To accurately deal with Karate's Influence on TKD, you need to provide a little context about Japanese/Korean history during colonial times.  A sentence to do this is more than appropriate.",0,0

Speedy deletion of This Is Fake DIY
 A tag has been placed on This Is Fake DIY, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G4 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a repost of material that was previously deleted following a deletion debate, such as at articles for deletion. Under the specified criteria, where an article has substantially identical content to that of an article deleted after debate, and any changes in the content do not address the reasons for which the material was previously deleted, it may be deleted at any time. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

I agree that discussing legal matters in an international encyclopedia is complex due to different laws in different countries, but that does not mean that nothing can be said on them, you can make remarks in terms of some/most/almost all countries; even a vaguer expression 'may be illegal' is meaningful, because many things are legal in all countries, such as the possession of a piece of bread.
Why is it silly to put a list of things you cannot possess in an article on possession? That is the place where it belongs, unless you make the list a separate article.

Yeah, i was reading around it and it's pretty bad as is.. as i see it, the Physical Chemistry article should be a similar kind of article as the Thermodynamics article is; an overview of the key principles included in the actual thing itself as well as the foundation of it. I've not got too many books on physical chemistry  on the article itself, i've only got about 4 of those mentioned.

The majority of the books i have featuring physical chemistry tell me also that chemical physics seem to be some forms of misprints, or so  there was a story on how someone published the name incorrectly due to the fact they thought it was mostly based in chemistry, so therefore it was chemistry with physics in it; chemical physics. Not too sure about it though.. chemical physics could be a pseudonym for thermodynamics of activation or something similar; who knows? The books, i guess! -)",0,0

Dear Aleta, 
You are right. I respect you a lot for you have supported my page without knowing me. You see, Aleta ,  I am a human not god. it's question of creditability  not only mine but also of an entity – identity  in question. I provided all the facts what so ever was demanded by wikipedian editors or opposers. But without investigating /verifying my news/reviews on Sonee , the administrator ruthlessly  deleted it under influence of  4-5 people. Have they kept  two lines over there on the person in question. I would had not raised my voice. Frustration & fighting for my democratic rights are two different issue. You can put me in any slot. It’s your view and mind. However ,  This might be an inspiration from  Sonee to me or person like Gandhi where person has to fight his  battle alone. Without dying no body can enjoy heaven. I have learnt form such people –if  you  are certain to certify self  reasoning or common sense considering it  ethically right then  least care what might the world think of you. One should act and speak right. & that’s what I am doing here. Few people have label my writing as soap box, unreliable etc… God bless them. They don’t know  about the person what revolution his voice is going to influence the world in future. Jesus, Kabir  did not changed the world in a day. No wikipedia was there then to suppress such voices or sharing their info. Strangely Good or  ridiculously bad human one day are in scripted in history. May be Jesus or Bin Laden. So my suggestion to you as a well wisher is never leave your good deed, Person like Graeme & You are rare angel breed. I can feel from my inner sense of little wisdom . I may or may not raise the page on Sonee as my mood is very upset @ present, but ever if couple of you angels feel to raise Sonee page once again any of  your good selves can go contribute for the betterment of world welfare deeds.  Try it. You will get a peaceful sleep. Because real angels never sleep unless they help a true person in difficulty successfully. They don’t leave the victim in middle of ocean.  I am fed up putting my points clicking reading all wiki pages. I  have gone mad to convince them. It’s just writing on sand.  So,  If your instinct feel Sonee deserve two line after reading below talk page of Graeme & Keeper76  feel free to raise a para on Sonee. That is enough for my satisfaction.

You do realize that a vast body of literature and academic works refers to the places in Ukraine solely by their Russian names, especially in historical contexts?

Including Russian names in the lede helps clarify this point, makes cross-referencing historical literature and Wikipedia articles possible, and generally improves our readers' experience.

Thanks for uploading Image:2003-02-26 lindsay sequence freethrow moving.gif. I noticed the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add , without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on [ this link]. Note that fair use images which could be replaced by free-licensed alternatives will be deleted 7 days after this notification, per our Fair Use policy.  If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you.  zzuuzz (talk) """,0,0

My own guess would be that it is a religious reference: that the three wise men referred to are, the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost.

You have to go to Don McLean's 'American Pie' for this.
 
""""...and the three men I admire most, the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost, they caught the last train for the coast, the day the music died, and they were singing..."""" 

The wise men come down from heaven (Blunt). Having caught the last train for the coast (McLean), those three men buy a semi by the sea (Blunt). 

On this basis, this song may be a general rant against human nature, mankind having mainly turned their backs on God. 

On earth, the 'wise men' (Father, Son and Holy Ghost) can't escape from bad human beings, and are actually sorry to have created mankind in the first place (mankind generally being """"pernickety little bastards in your fancy dress / Who just judge each other and try to impress"""".) 

God only made man because he was """"trying to have some fun"""", but he made a mess of the product (i.e. human nature is imperfect) and now he can't 'escape from' mankind, can't 'be free from' mankind, And has 'no way out' of the problem that mankind is, and the imperfect creation God has made on earth. So God takes refuge from us on the coast.
 
As individuals, and as the human race collectively, if we proceed in a godless way, we have to ask ourselves the question """"Where are we now?"""" 

Blunt isn't alone however, as he himself has God. 

Only my guess. Pure speculation. Probably well wide of the mark, I suppose someone else will tell me.

Notability of Kyle raymond
A tag has been placed on Kyle raymond, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion. To do this, add  on the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

This will also put in perspective the recent inflation of Nobel laureates in the sciences, which is easy to explain: most of the recent laureates had to share the prize while most of the early laureates got a full prize.  The lists of laureates by university or by country must take this into account as well. For example, Glauber (US), Hall (US) and Hänsch (Germany) shared the physics prize of 2005. But we cannot simply add 2.00 points to the US count and 1.0 to the German count. Instead we have to add 0.75 to the US count and 0.25 to the German count (Hänsch and Hall each got only 0.25 of the prize, Glauber got 0.5). Otherwise we'd violate the Nobel Prize conservation law:  The sum of the Nobel Prizes per year is constant; you may divide it among many laureates, but then the laureates necessarily become less outstanding on average.",0,0

(Civil Engineering, 1981) (Structural Engineering), M.S (Engineering Mechanics, 1983), and, Ph.D. (Materials Engineering Science, 1992) Virginia Polytechnic. """"Her dissertation involved the development of an experimental method to measure thermal stresses in bimaterial joints. She has taught courses including Experimental Stress Analysis, Engineering Mechanics, Mechanics of Materials (Strength of Materials), Strength of Materials Testing. From 1999 to 2006 Dr. Wood has been an assistant professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina. Before moving to Clemson she spent three years as a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics at Virginia Tech. Dr. Wood is currently writing a book with Morgan Reynolds on the physical evidence explaining the events on 9/11. One of Dr. Wood’s research interests is biomimicry, or applying the mechanical structures of biological materials to engineering design using engineering materials. Other recent research has investigated the deformation behavior of materials and structures with complex geometries and complex material properties, such as fiber-reinforced composite materials and biological materials. Dr. Wood is an expert in the use of moiré interferometry, a full-field optical method that is used in stress analysis. Dr. Wood has over 60 technical publications in refereed journals, conference proceedings, and edited monographs and special technical reports. Dr. Wood started to question the events of 9/11 on that same day when what she saw and heard on television was contradictory and appeared to violate the laws of physics. Since that day she has used her knowledge of engineering mechanics to prove that the collapse of the World Trade Center twin towers could not have happened as the American public was told.

These quotes are cast members speaking highly of each other, and frankly, good public relations by supporting their on-screen chemistry and by extension, that of the fictional characters they play.  Many other cast members have complimented their co-stars, including PD and EP, but no reliable source has, to my knowledge, ever published information that these two were anything other than co-stars who happen to be friends.

As I say, you can't read English closely and this generates numerous misprisions in your understanding both of sources and what others say.
A pointer, one of many possible ones, on how not to construe elementary English.
I am completely indifferent to whatever geneticists say about history, unless they are practiced historians.
(a)does not allow you to infer, and repeatedly say, that the meaning is: Nishadani clearly stated that are not familiar with population genetics, nor they believe in that science.'
Where in that sentence do I state that I am unfamiliar with population genetics, and disbelieve that discipline? I am saying nothing about genetics: I am stating my scepticism about geneticists stepping outside their discipline to make arguments about another discipline, namely historiography. Peer-reviewed geneticists have RS credibility as geneticists, not historians, as peer-reviewed historians have RS competence as historians, not geneticists. Sometimes you have dual competence, as with C.D. Darlington, or Jits van Straten, but the geneticists you cite, if you check the historical books in their bibliographies, use dated or unreliable sources for their history, and make frequent errors, as many reviews have shown.
(b)'You protest my writing:'What geneticists define as 'Jewishness' in Europe relates to male founder genes' and call me a racist who insults Jews.
Here you fail to understand what geneticists define as 'Jewishness'. I am not using that language, the view is not therefore mine. If you have a problem with this take it up with Harry Ostrer, whose work you keep citing, or with experienced science reporters who report him saying that markers on the DNA reveal """"a biological basis for Jewishness,""""..
Reflect on this. You keep screwing up the obvious meaning of sentences. It's a reportable offence to do this when one of the consequences of your failure to understand my English is that you imdulge in wildly false accusations that a reasonable editor, making reasonable remarks, is an antisemite.

Trip to Big Roudný

TABThe easier way to Big Roudný is from the going to Křištanovice. We will go along the guidepost from the upper crossing in Roudno. We are on the top in half an hour, where a big information board is placed and next to it there is a cone hollow, which is considered to be the rest of the crater. A rebuilt small chapel is placed on the top. Behind the chapel there are 15 pictures of the Station of the Cross on the stands. If we go downhill, we come to two stony mounds with a cross – to the victims of the 1st Word War in 1914 – 1918. More ambitous tourists can go down from the mound maybe 30m downhill to a visible road which goes out from the forest and go on along a meadow path at first to the southern direction and then turn down the way to the road to Bílčice.",0,0

Allstarecho is correct in what he says. There is no reference to male-male sexual relationships in the section: Personal relationships. Here is what it currently says, in it's entirety: 
James's personal relationships included relationships with his male courtiers and his marriage to Anne of Denmark, with whom he fathered his children. Growing up, James did not have any parents, for his father, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, was murdered and his mother, Mary I of Scotland was forced to flee when she married the suspected murderer, James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell. His grandfather was assassinated during his boyhood, and he had no siblings.[103][104]
Someone reading the article as it is now would have no idea that there is any debate about James's sexuality. The word """"relationships"""" could mean anything, depending. I also agree with Carcharoth that the current concepts of gay and homosexual are quite different from Jacobean England's, as are concepts of male bonding, friendship, and what's acceptable in society across most cultures and time periods. However, there are reliable sources that say James had sexual relationships with at least some of his male associates. Call it what you will, but excising that from the main article section is not fair. Don't use modern terms if that is the issue. Also, the section should be in rough proportion to the other summary sections in this article, and several of them are approx 230 to 330 words long. Footnote #24 is 117 words. I would agree to move the footnote up to that section and integrate it, including the assertion that it is murky, and debated.  Even if that section is shorter, as long as it gives readers the idea that there is debate about James's sexuality. Then work on the daughter article per the suggestion. That seems fair and balanced, something that I wish to work toward. But to excise mention of anything other than platonic/family relations from the main article is not. Sorry, but footnotes don't count. People just don't generally read them. —   """,0,0

Given what has happened with this article, I don’t think CNFK is really going to give anything to Wikipedia.  There have been three charges that these images were stolen and now apparently some discussion that OberRanks, who is supposed to be Husnock an active duty naval officer, plans to misuse naval communications systems to send out more stolen insignia.  I don’t really think he would do that because you can go to prison for five years for misuse of government computer systems especially in a criminal way.  I also think a commissioned officer would have better things to do than to get involoved in any of this, but that’s just me.  But, you see CNFK probably now won’t touch this article with a ten foot pole.  Someone should just link it to another site that already has pictures of these insignia and not bother about trying to get them from the Navy: T. Hodge, E9, RA -

The current lead implies Israeli aggression against Hamas by stating that Israel killed several Hamas members in Khan Yunis on July 6, and Hamas retaliated with rockets.

However, it may also be worth noting that Israel maintains the Hamas members killed in Khan Yunis accidentally blew themselves up in one of their tunnels: """"Hamas has vowed revenge for what it saw as Israel's deadliest attacks in which six Palestinian militants died, though Israel denied any involvement...The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted """"terror sites and concealed rocket launchers"""" in the enclave, but had not hit the southern Gaza area of Rafah, on the Egyptian border, where the Hamas gunmen died. Military spokesman Lerner said the militants had died when explosives went off in a tunnel that Israel had bombed several days ago, fearing gunmen planned to use it to try and penetrate into Israel."""" It turns out the same account was given by The New York Times: """"When Hamas militants entered the damaged tunnel a day or so later, they apparently set off explosives there...Hamas blamed Israel, escalating the hostilities that grew into the current confrontation.""""

In response to User Hoary's topic The term """"Ebonics"""" and the appearance of a legal threat

Ernie Smith writes

I maintain that those who view and use the word Ebonics as being a synonym for BE, AAVE and other English language based appellations, are either totally ignorant of the origin and true meaning of the word Ebonics or they are fully aware of the origin and true meaning of the word Ebonics and elect to use word Ebonics as a synonym for BE, AAVE and other English language based appellations, with the intent to deceive. Since by definition to counterfeit is to: “try to deceive by pretense or dissembling.” the propagation of a false definition of the word ‘Ebonics’ as being a synonym for BE, AAVE other English language based appellations, with the intent to deceive, is larcenous counterfeiting. Given that by definition """"to steal and pass off the ideas or words of another as one’s own"""" and using a """"created production without crediting the source"""" is plagiarism or literary theft, when use is made of the word Ebonics (an original idea and word coined by Dr. Robert Williams as a synonym for BE, AAVE and other English language based appellations, this deceptive pattern of practice is ‘plagiaristic’ dishonesty or ‘literary theft’ that violates national and international laws protecting ‘intellectual property’ rights. This kind of plagiarism or stealth of ‘intellectual property’ via literary theft and the intentional perversion of the truth should not be tolerated and the authors of articles and books as well as publishers of dictionaries including Wikipedia, progating counterfeit and plagiaristic definitions of the word Ebonics must be held accountable.

db87566bb2d0f48b,"NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL 

I am writing this message to you as a notice of my withdrawal from Wikipedia following the recent events/edits on the CNN and Susan Roesgen pages – events that you were involved in.  Never in all of my years in academia (the better part of a decade) have I been privy to such patently-insincere and downright academically-fraudulent work as that which I have encountered on Wikipedia.
While I was initially willing to set aside all of the negative things I had heard about Wikipedia in an effort to contribute to a seemingly beneficial project, the actions of editors and administrators on the  Susan Roesgen and CNN pages has made it eminently clear that “scholarship” and Wikipedia truly are mutually exclusive – propaganda has carried the day.
My failure to grace the project with some actual academically-sound work was not made in vain; with every neutral editor that you drive out of the project with your blatantly POV-pushing agenda, you further bolster your reputation as nothing but an unreliable propaganda board. Your reputation for unreliability was perhaps best captured in a recent statement made by my corporations professor: “I decided to make myself more ignorant on the topic by looking at the article (Dodge v. Ford Motor Company) on Wikipedia.”
I strongly encourage you to alter your course, set aside your agenda, and reverse your – and Wikipedia’s – reputation as a laughing stock. This will not only benefit the public in general, but will, I submit, actually make you feel better about yourself. Best, J.M.",0,0

Advice
To save me writing too much, a lot of this is going to be links to existing policies and guidelines - there is plenty of advice available, in fact a confusing amount, so pointers may be helpful. The guide to writing Your First Article and the Business' FAQ are particularly useful.

Wikipedia frowns on writing about your own organisation because of worries that someone with a conflict of interest will not be able to write from the Neutral Point of View which is one of our three key content policies. (The others are Verifiability and No Original Research). However, the anonymity of account names means it can't be prohibited, and it may be better to have a declared interest than somone pushing a case anonymously.

It should be possible for you to write an article about your organisation that won't get deleted, if you are careful. The first essential is to avoid any hint of promotion - be drily factual, as though you were unconnected with the organisation and had no interest in it, but were documenting it for completeness. See the guideline on peacock terms.

The next point is likely to be the problem if your organisation is new - notability, which is the Wikipedia term for """"of enough general interest for an encyclopedia article"""". See the guidelines on Notability and Notability (organisations and companies). What you have to do is find references from reliable sources which are independent of you. Your own web-site etc are not considered independent. Has there been comment on your organisation, e.g. in the trade press? It may be that you will have to wait until you are more established and can cite independent references.

I wrote the above off-line: now that I come to post it, I see you have run into another problem - copyright. That's more of a problem than you might think, because everything in WP must released under the """"GFDL"""" which says that anyone may do anything with it including rework it for commercial use - so just saying """"I agree to this being put in"""" is not enough. The notice above tells you what you can do, but for the reasons in my third para above it is very likely that your mission statement will not be in suitable terms for Wikipedia, so the solution to the copyright problem may well be to rewrite it. That leads me to a last warning: an important difference between Wikipedia and a business directory is that you will not own your article - see WP:OWN - other people can and will edit it. See the warning at the bottom of the page you use to edit: """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others, do not submit it.""""

I have found the original answer in the archives garbage historic, after intervention of Töbel, here it comes:

 Dear Val, who is also a mormon [or a parrots, 'ain't sure]

I found very strange that each time I am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question, it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. 
I do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you, nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. 
I think that the person concern, Storm Rider, is grown up enough to do so on its own. 
Unless next time I am under attack, you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. It could be interesting. 
If you have something to say, say it so, but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit, as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don't know what to say. 
So do the wisest, just shut up! 
It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed, and as you can see, repeating it indefinitely like rot speach, is not going to give you the ability to understand. 
All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. 
Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light. 
I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction, more than a physical unhability to comprehend, expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. 
You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. 
As for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie, what about you? Are you VAL? or are you rama? or are you DGL626, there is a lot of nick name on wiki, and all of them cover up a real name. 
They are all a pseudonym, meaning they are anonymous. 
So if I take the name """"anonymous"""" as a pseudo, I will be as hiding and as showing as you are, because at the end, in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.

So what are you trying to proove, except the fact that you were unable to figure what I just told you on your own? 
I had a name, this name seems now to be unavailable, and I dont feel to make it again or take another. 
Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki, old rats as well as newbees (hahaha) and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian, thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience, and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition, so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality, who is wikis first rule? 
It is all a lie. 
How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? 
It isnt equality it is power struggle. 
It is adversity, and supremacy and group pressure as here. 
WIKI is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression, it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view, on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality!

HA HA! 
Make me laught, but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies. 
Please, in the future, avoid using words that you do not fully understand, as """"logic"""". 
For your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously, do some research first. 
I speak 9 languages: 
English, danish, french, german, norvegian, swedish, occitan, latin, greek, and geek!

5 of them fluently, the others as pocket use. Like german I can read a book but I dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me 2 3 weeks to get back the rythm. 
As a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero, maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the US, but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages. In europe from age 11 we choose between 3 languages: english german and spanish, at age 13, we have to chose another one, and choose between english german, spanish italian russian, from age 15, when we begin graduate school, we have to take another one, and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american, and a dialect or local language, and can also take hebrew. 
2 to 3 languages are part of the compulsory pensum. 
I also took extra english dialect as the one spoken by semi natives in australia, and english dialect spoken in India. 
That was for learning",0,0

 Re your block of User:Witysmartone 

Hi, just wondering why you only blocked for 24 hours?  If you look at the contribs that user has failed to make a single constructive edit so far - normally that warrants an indefinite block?    
Nothing too mysterious. ) The user was only active for about 40 minutes, in all. In my experience with basic vandal accounts, the duration of the block only rarely makes any difference in practice. Most times, they never return even after a short block. In the event they do return, they'll either continue disrupting the project (in which case it's easy enough to re-block) or will contribute helpfully (in which case we're better off than when we started); in the former case, the indefinitely blocked vandal will be quite able to return using another account, anyway, so the term """"indefinite"""" can be a bit misleading. If there is a danger in this strategy, it's in allowing a number of iffy accounts to sit around autoconfirmed, but we tend to do that already, with a few thousand every day. –

Fastfission, I welcome your thoughts on the article and examples. In defense, here is some reply to the most telling point (and heart of the method) The """"predictions"""" section puts the horse before the cart: Watson had already seen the B-form photograph before they thought of proposing the double helix. In Watson's Double Helix memoir, he clearly states that he and Crick had already worked out the mathematics of the Fourier transform of a Helix as an X-shape. They had come upon it with the TMV (tobacco mosaic virus) and had already deduced TMV had a spiral shape. At the time of discovery (of structure of DNA) they did not know the orientation of the bases (inside or outside the helix) which Watson deduced by his concrete modelling of the nucleotide pairs. The discovery (of structure of DNA) came after, at least according to Watson's memoir. And Watson is still alive to clarify this for us. It is a golden opportunity for someone to ask and write down so that we can cite. But the article clearly states that scientific method is not linear, as you have well put. It is a horse-race between the steps, some of which can then be linearized after the moment of discovery, for publication. I do not mind the adjective lousy; in Feynman's words English is a lousy language, yet we somehow manage to communicate with it, and those of us who are prisoners of the tongue even attempt to think with it as well.

You are warned.
You have, you and different mormons users, vandalise the talk page as a group in order to eliminate contributions of non mormons who disturbed you and I found this unacceptable and against all wikis essentials rules.
I will therefor not bow under you threats and insist for the intervention of a non mormon administrator who isnt a personal friend as well.
There is clear discriminatorics actions who have to stop and being alone against 10, it is difficult but not all impossible.
I simply cant accept that a group of religious extremists insist on imposing their views on different talkpage at the cost of wikipedias rule of equality and neutrality and at the cost of real information as well.
 I am not hiding as you are all doing so at the moment nor lying and pretending something else.
I do reply to those attacks, but I have the dignity to leave place for the other users, and to dont revert their texts and to in fact reinsert their answers and questions with mine who were deleeted with theirs.
The excuse of archiving is very thin seen in the light of the real purpose, and rearrching in less than 24 hours, after only 4 posts, is unacceptable and to spit at wikipedias face.
Do you think that all wikipedians are idiots and cannot see what you are trying to do?
I was called a troll, a lyer many times, insulted, and anyway terminated my contributions and answers to this with: """"kind regards"""", that was until the joke went too far, and the insults too loud, and the circus was too obvious that I used a more direct language, but it was not before you started those mass reverting actions disguise as archiving that I really went angry and asked for proper explainations.
Which you answer to by reverting even more.
I dont accept this.
You have no rights to do so and your insistency at grabing at wikis morality and set of rules to cover up for your diffamations is both hysterical and an hypocrisie who do not fool anybody.
i can see that you have all a long time training at doing so as you exchan´ge each time who is going to bear the hat...this way each person remain innocent as the guilt is dispearsed among as many as possible.
Very smart, but not less dishonnest nor more invisible.
Try pronoïa instead of being all trying to found something wrong about me and come back to my first text to wich you never answered and most certainly never read to understand it. You read it to critisized it.
Here is the result of your crusade.
Are you happy with it?

Dear disconspinster,
I do see you're a pretty efficient contributor/fixer here in Wiki and well-recognised as well, but the article Interrelated Demand and Supply which you just deleted and redirected had additional information that was not present anywhere in Wikipedia at all, which focuses on the definition of the different types of relationships for complementary goods.

Of course the original stuff that i wrote on Interrelated Demand and Supply should probably go somewhere on Elasticity or Complementary Goods, but i wanted to provide more information without sullying the neat and organized data on those above two pages, so i'd created another page and hope someone tidies it up a bit and merges it with the other articles. Didn't expect it to get deleted though. I'm going to revert the original back and hope someone with better economic knowledge will come along and merge it somewhere, since I'm new at this wiki formatting thing.",0,0

228537b833ad4f38,"Ooooh, here's our Swiss neutralist! And what does this administrator bring to the table this time? Let's see, accusations of parroting, arbitrary classification of users based upon pen-name preferences, straw-men, ignoratio elenchi, and finally begging the question through the same fallacious reasoning as previously. We call that petitio principii, don't we? Apparently nothing will change his mind until I change my pen-name to something like John Doe. How does he know that I am not this Russian dude who likes Iranian history and culture? Oh, that's right, he doesn't. He probably didn't check my IP-address to see that I'm based in Sweden and could in fact be a Swede. Whoops... Sounds like our neutralist is using a subtle profiling method to his convenience.

Like I stated before, it doesn't matter if I'm a Nazi, Communist, Liberal or even a hippie. It doesn't matter if I do drugs, or if I look even remotely like a reptile. It doesn't matter if I'm even an obese Tongan kid. It has no bearing on content or the essentials of an argument, and anything else you might conjure to the favour of some imagined affiliation. This is aptly called speculation.

Now, I will only say two things. First one is a rehearsal of my previous suggestion: Livius.org is visited by thousands of people daily. Along with a number of other scholar-related websites, I can't live without checking it by a daily basis. It deserves a Wiki-article, where Jona Lendering is briefly described as the founder and maintainer of an outlet with roots as far back as -96. Yes, sounds like a plan of revenge. The paragon of Pan-Iranic resurgence! The removal of a Wiki-article of Lendering will remove the last great obstacle to a resurgent Achaemenid empire and the reawakening of the terrifying Persian horsemen of doom! Howl! Howl! Our world is forfeit!

Second point, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Get laid. Your superior-inferior complex isn't convincing anyone here, whether they be Iranian or not. There is no chance an article of this quality gets to stay. That's the bottom line, irrespective of any perceived reasoning. Either change the article so that it pertains to Livius.org, or stop your incessant whining. Maybe it never occurred to you that by simple observation Jona Lendering has written several Iran-friendly articles and has generally sought to dispel several popular misconceptions on the ancient Iranians. Maybe that's how you make more drama in your life, by arbitrary holier-than-thou attitude.

The term pharaoh
Hey, while reading the reviewer's comment on Khufu, I saw you response regarding the term pharaoh: """"Respond: This form was choosed cuz Egyptologists today prefer to say """"king"""" before """"pharaoh"""", since the latter term is of greek origin and brought up in greek-roman epoques.Nephiliskos (talk) """"
Well this is not true. The term pharaoh is not of greek origin but of egyptian origin, pr-3ˁ per-aa, meaning the great house. The term in fact refers to the palace of the king and came to used for the king's estate and finally for the king himself during the Saite period ca 650BC, well before the classical greco-roman times (starting ca 500BC). Thus the term pharaoh was used by ancient egyptian to refer to their king, albeit at a very point moment in history. Furthermore not so many scholar are against the use of pharaoh which is, in fact, the standard English term to refer to the ancient Egyptian kings. Thus I would strongly advise you to king the term pharaoh throughout the article.  """,0,0

1. Inline citations are not required by policy

No policy requires inline citations. They are often a good idea, and are a requirement for feature article status, but it is not a requirement for all articles. Furthermore, the tag is often used when the article has adequate sources. This tag therefore enshrines a particular editor's view about style (that the article in question should have inline citations) in an inappropriate way. That point belongs on the talk page, not in the article itself. Robert A.West (Talk) 

    Where does it say that featured articles have different requirements then other articles? Jeepday 

        The whole point in to get citations for all articles so that they meet the WP:V requirements, I have noticed that tags quite often help by bringing this to attention of users, particularly new-ish users. Cheers SeanMack 

            I agree with Jeepday and SeanMack. Our ultimate goal should be for every article to be of FA quality.  Satori Son 

                That goal is not consensus among editors. But more importantly, inline citations for every fact are not an FA requirement; see WP:FA? section 1c. CMummert · talk

Within the last few weeks, two bloggers for the former North Carolina senator resigned after being hit with criticism from conservative Catholic organizations angered by past anti-Catholic remarks the bloggers posted on the Web, according to CNN.

A poor start, sorry. The author seems to be totally mislead about both real history and the opinions on the table. First of all, no common two-nations table is possible (patent nonsense). Second, I object the following:
the passage from the Russian table speaking of the Kievan Rus. As someone suggested earlier, that table should by any mean include a disclaimer explaining very loose ancestry between Kievan Rus and modern Russia. This is the main disputed claim (commented enough in other articles), unacceptable for me and several other Ukrainian and Belarusian users
Regardless of any """"Ukrainian military"""" table, none of them may include the Red Army. This army was not only irrelevant to any of Ukrainian states (with very formal post-WWII exception), but also significantly anti-Ukrainian. For instance, Red Army units widely participated in war crimes against Ukrainian population and anti-Soviet guerillas. Creation of the """"Ukrainian"""" table here has been a mere discussion trick not supported by all Ukrainian users. For instance, see earlier AlexPU's passage on """"trading the truth""""

Given all that, I'd suggest you to delete your first draft and find other ways for compromising. Mr.Buckshot, I thank you, an innocent editor, for your valuable attempts and hope for further cooperation on the issue.  """,0,0

Some Wikipedia editors have proposed that Wikipedia article content should be in proportion to article count. In other words, if there are 5 articles about Suburban Express about history, competitive battles, etc., and 20 """"articles"""" (blog posts, mostly) about the recent newsy trash that 80% of the article should relate to the recent newsy trash. One big problem with that is the fact that many of the blog articles are simply regurgitated from one seminal article or two. In other words, if there are 20 blog articles, there may be 18 that are essentially copied from the initial two. If the body count method of assigning weight is accepted, duplicate/regurgitated articles should probably be ignored.

 Speedy Deletion """"Dogsoc"""" as patent nonsense 

Hi Dreadstar
Could you please rehabilitate the """"Dogsoc"""" article you deleted to some private talk space so that we can work with it and convert it to brilliant prose and all the other stuff. Would appreciate a little room / time to work on this one - since it is not patent nonsense although it may appear so at first blush.  

I will reply for Dreadstar, and he can respond  if he needs to. Let me first explain the concept of verifiability, which is a core pillar of Wikipedia. Another thing is notability, which basically means that you can create an acronym about something, but that does not make it automatically notable. Without citations to reliable, third-party sources (such as news articles, professional journal articles, magazine articles, etc.,), then articles are likely to be deleted. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and, additionally, I would like to point you to the conflict of interest guideline, because your username is the same as the title of the article. The COI guideline explains that editors should not create or edit articles about themselves, their company, organization, product, or family or friends, as they would likely be unable to edit neutrally. Neutrality is another of Wikipedia's core policies. I'd encourage you to review the policies and guidelines given here, and once you have, consider if indeed, the article you submitted was verifiable by multiple reliable sources, and displayed notability. Cheers! Ariel♥Gold

Thanks Ariel, better get some foot warmers for that poor doggie!   † 

Dogsoc, the article consisted of an acronym and six sentences describing what the acronym meant, none of which was verifiable per WP:Verifiability, and which miserably failed Wikipedia:Notability.  The only claim to verifiability was a presumed """"xerox copy"""" of an """"underground magazine"""" published in 1976 purportedly recently acquired and alleged to be undergoing the """"process of being translated and scanned.""""  The contents of the article, although short, were quite inflammatory, making unfounded accusations against governmental """"regulatory assassins"""", etc.  All in all, it added up to, quite frankly, patent nonsense with no meaningful content.  † 

Dreadstar, Wiki has many articles devoted to acronyms (such as United Nations, United States of America). Referring to the recently acquired document, there is now a stay order of the concerned High Court on publication of this document. We can *Now* cite the judgement's link on an OFFICIAL Govt. High Court website (which ought to meet reputable source /verificability criteria). For DOGSOC notability a simple google (is this verifiable?) news search on """"Nandigram"""" should do. Finally I may mention Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View Policy which is absolutely non-negotiable.  
Dogsoc, you do not seem to have read the links provided to you. You say """"DOGSOC"""" is on Google, but here is the Google search result for DOGSOC  with a total of  one article from 1910, not related to this article you are claiming is notable. The words you said it stands for, """"Dismantling our Governments Selling our Cities"""", a Google search comes up with again, nothing:  None of this has anything to do with POV, it has to do with, again, verifiability and reliable, third-party sources that establish the notability. Yes, USA, UN, and many, many other acronyms have pages here, but they are notable, mentioned in the news, media, and other reliable sources. This acronym is not. Further, you may wish to review the single purpose account guide as well. Thanks, Ariel[[Special:C",0,0

In the chart named 'Chart of South Slavic languages and dialects' someone has changed the basically known fact that the politically created standards of the SerboCroatian language, such as Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, Bunjevac, etc., they all belong to the Central South Slavic languages, and they don't belong in the same group with Slovenian language (which is Western group of South Slavic Languages).

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh",1,1

Page Creation
So, I started the page. This is probably going to get heated, some people accusing me of saying the Course is a """"hoax"""" and all that. But I think this is an issue worthy of a page on Wikipedia because this is an important aspect of the Course. This might be interesting and beneficial. 

  

This article needs to be merged with the ACIM article or deleted
It's an issue worthy of a section of the A Course In Miracles page. It definitely isn't worth a separate article. If, as you suggest, Jesus was a source, then it deserves to be part of that article. If He wasn't, then it doesn't deserve to be anywhere. Either way, it doesn't need a separate page. 

-...wha? 

Well, that's completely just an opinion on your part. Another member and I have been discussing this on the main A Course In Miracles page. We both agreed that this deserves its own page as the topic is too expansive to maintain within the already lengthy main ACIM page. Have you taken a look at the other aspects of ACIM that have pages of their own? This certainly deserves its own page as well. And I might add that this page is not about whether I say the Course is channeled/scribed from Jesus literally. It is intended as the beginnings of an article about what is actually said in the Course and the different perspectives among """"students"""" and """"teachers"""" of the Course. Whether I myself believe one way or another has no bearing on this topic or the page itself. 
 

The existing ACIM main article is already quite long, and is intended more to be a summary of ACIM (believe it or not).  This topic is clearly a more in depth treatment of one aspect of the philosophy of ACIM than the main article, and may require its own separate long article in order to treat this subject properly.  My sense is, why not give this article a couple of weeks to settle and develop before making any clear determination about where it belongs (or doesn't belong)?

- 

 I concur. The ACIM page is quite large, and this issue is quite large.  

Removed """"Merge"""" notice

I removed the """"merge"""" notice. So far, it is three to one that this should remain its own article. If someone thinks I should give it more time, then please replace the """"merge"""" notice.   

""""Exposing a hoax""""

(Copied and pasted from discussion on main ACIM page.)

I think there is a huge misunderstanding here. I have never used the word """"hoax."""" It appears to me that you and some others who have discussed this with me, seem to think I am attempting to expose the Course, and now Catholicism, as a hoax. If you understand what I am talking about with regard to symbols, then you understand that there is no intention to """"expose a hoax"""" on my part. 

Is math a hoax to use """"5"""" all the while there are no """"5"""" characters out there in our physical world? I could stand here and go, """"Well, you know, math is all a lie, a hoax, because there really are no 5's. They've lied to you."""" Or I can say, """"The human mind cannot comprehend the principles expressed in math without use of those symbols, such as the symbol '5'."""" 

This is all I'm saying about the Course and Catholicism. 

If, as I believe, there was never literally a man who lived and was known as Jesus (and I'm not passionate about this topic one way or another, actually), then what I am saying is that even for the Catholic Church, Jesus is ultimately just a symbol. If the Catholic Church can be seen as """"math,"""" then Jesus is their """"5"""". Do you get what I mean? The symbol of """"Jesus"""" stands for something that is very real, though the symbol itself might not have actually existed in concrete, physical reality. 

The """"Jesus"""" in Catholicism (and I'm a former Catholic) often stood for persecution, suffering, agony, pain, and there is little argument from most that Catholicism brought exactly this to the world in many ways. Look at the Inquisition, and all the other horrible things the church did. And, for them, they did it in the name of """"Jesus."""" For them, Jesus symbolizes the need to do all these things. The things they did in the name of the symbol are very real; though the symbol might not have actually existed in concrete, physical reality on this planet.

 Good Article Progress... 

There are several great Disney character articles on Wikipedia, but very few of them are classified GA. I am really trying to transform Belle into a good article, like Ariel from The Little Mermaid...how am I doing so far? Thoughts? Suggestions? I know the article is no where near nomination status...I would just like a few guidelines.

Just a thought but other minor films that she appeared in could be merged down in one section with a few mentions about the films without going into huge detail about them. Something like she's appeared in spin-off films regarding the character, something like that you know? Doesn't need a subsection for each movie it makes the article clunky. All of her appearances don't have to be put into such great detail; like the Kingdom Hearts info goes too far into the it, just a short summary would suffice. And I'm sure that you're aware that the article needs more info on the character's cultural impact, stuff like that. The information on the development seems, okay same amount in the Ariel article so there's that. I'd suggest getting rid of the list of Broadway Actresses it's kind of an eye sore, just a thought. Or put it to prose Yum. 

Another thing I noticed while I was editing the page, there are a lot of references to IMDB (the whole production cast and stuff like that, you used IMDB) when there are a lot of other options. The film usually has documentaries on production where you can get that info; that's where I got a lot of info when writing the Ariel article, and the commentaries are useful too. What I'm saying is that there's a tone of info on this character out there (the Blu-Ray has a tone of extras and documentaries that could be of use). And if you don't own the dvds or whatever I'd assume YouTube could be of service. And when you're citing your sources remember to put the original date that the information was published and all the access date stuff too. But it's going to take a while Yum. 

Believe it or not, I have actually been trying to use sources other than IMDb. The majority of my character development information came from other online sources. As for film and production documentaries, I am still new on learning how to source those, but I will look into it. And I always thought the """"date"""" section in the source template was meant for the date that you found the information. Thanks for letting me know!   

 Belle's eye color 

First off, there are no evidence that Belle's eyes are brown, just like there are no evidence that Aurora's eyes are blue. The movies, the Disney Princess website, the franchise and merchandise, and official artwork all depict Belle with hazel eyes and Aurora with violet eyes. And saying that there's only one person in the entire world who believes Belle's eyes are hazel is ridiculous. Search the internet, the people who believe her eyes are hazel are way more than the people who believe her eyes are brown.

People who claim her eyes are brown have no evidence to back that up. An article with an interview with the voice actress is not a good evidence, it's just a bunch of words. What evidence does the voice actress herself have to back up what she's saying?! It can't be any of the movies, they tell a different story.

A quote from the actress - """"She was also the first brown-eyed princess, the rest had blue eyes. She had a quirkiness and an oddness about her so many girls identified with Belle because they feel there is a part of her that is like them.""""

There are THREE lies buried in that first sentence; 1) Snow White was the first brown-eyed princess, not someone else. 2) Not all of the previous Princesses have blue eyes; Snow White has brown eyes and Aurora has violet eyes - that's half (2 out of 4) of the Princesses that do not have blue eyes. And 3) Belle's eyes are not brown as the movies themselves and other stuff will show you.

There's nothing wrong with articles as long as they don't condradict anything, but Paige O'Hara's words contradicted not one, but THREE things about the Disney Princesses.",0,0

Dear , even though I did not review the article myself I could offer you some pointers as to what to do. My main concern is twofold, given the article contains a lot of unnecessary information, which in turn is referenced by primary or unreliable sources. My first tip would be for you to focus on the things that make him notable, such as his work with the BBC, or his oceanic work; strip it to the indispensable minimum. There's also no need to list works or awards. Try sourcing information from reliable and independent sources that discuss him exclusively or in a substantial proportion of the text. If you can't find such sourcing, it'd be best if you didn't include that particular piece of biographical information. His works, partnerships or any associations should not be used as citations. Good sources would be similar to the People article, for example. I'm afraid my sort of copy edits would be quite drastic and disheartening for you, so I look forward to seeing how you manage to improve the article yourself. Feel free to post any questions at the Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Help desk, and resubmit the article for reviewal when pertinent (make sure you edit the article at least once every couple of months so that it's not deleted).

80964bc23ecd4a50,""":Thanks Tom - that's a much better summary than the previous one. One question: in the comparison of UKIP's performance to that of other parties, I think saying that the SNP polled less than UKIP could be misleading for non-UK readers. If I didn't know that the SNP only stood candidates in Scotland, I'd get the impression from the current text that UKIP did much better than the SNP on average. But knowing that UKIP put up candidates across the country (while the SNP didn't) gives quite a different impression, since, of course, the SNP polled much better than UKIP everywhere it put up candidates. So for the benefit of non-UK readers, in the section comparing UKIP's performance to that of the Lib Dems and SNP, perhaps it might be helpful to add """"ahead of the Scottish National Party (who only contested seats in Scotland)""""?

I won't make that addition unless you approve, though.

Oh, one more thing - do we have a quote from a UKIP official or UKIP press release on the official reaction to the election result, or a link to an article about it? It would be interesting for readers to see what 'spin' the party put on what might otherwise be regarded as quite a disappointing result for them.

I'm not alone believing this was not a case of outing, and making unproven allegations of misconduct, in this case outing, is also a form of personal attack designed to undermine the other editor, and Offliner has been warned in the past not to file such vexatious claims. Offliner is a veteran of filing complaints on WP:AE, and if this comes under WP:DIGWUREN (and Kuril Islands dispute seems to fall outside of the scope of that case being Eastern Europe), he should know that board would have been the more appropriate place to lodge that complaint, but perhaps he wouldn't have achieved the same result.

Starting a new section here because the preceding is hopelessly indented.

DCstats and ERosa, you are mistaken in your thinking. Jdannan and Avenue are quite correct. I know this might be very difficult for you to accept. You claim to have references supporting your interpretation. However, I think you are misinterpreting the statements from the textbooks you are reading. I can't speak for your """"petroleum industry statistican"""" friend. My guess is that you conveyed your misinterpretation of the situation to him/her. I have a ph.d. in mathematics and after reading this talk page and thinking I was almost losing my mind, I consulted with several other ph.d. mathematician and statistician friends of mine who confirmed that Jdannan and Avenue are indeed correct. And the interpretation given in the article is basically correct as well. In fact, it's the interpretation I've seen given in every stats book I've looked at.

Some references, since these seem to be very important to people:

""""Warning! There is much confusion about how to interpret a confidence interval. A confidence interval is not a probability statement about θ since θ is a fixed quantity, not a random variable."""" — Larry Wasserman, All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference, p. 92
""""CAUTION! A 95% confidence interval does not mean that there is a 95% probability that the interval contains μ. Remember, probability describes the likelihood of undetermined events. Therefore, it does not make sense to talk about the probability that the interval contains μ, since the population mean is a fixed value. Think of it this way: Suppose I flip a coin and obtain a head. If I ask you to determine the probability that the flip resulted in a head, it would not be 0.5, because the outcome has already been determined. Instead the probability is 0 or 1. Confidence intervals work the same way. Because μ is already determined, we do not say that there is a 95% probability that the interval contains μ."""" — Michael Sullivan III, Statistics: Informed Decisions Using Data, p. 453
""""The idea of interval estimation is complicated; an example is in order. Suppose that, for each λ, x is a real random variable normally distributed about λ with unit variance; then, as is very easy to see with the aid of a table of the normal distribution, if M(x) is taken to be the interval [x − 1.9600, x + 1.9600], then (1) P(λ in M(x) | λ) = α, where α is constant and almost equal to 0.95. It is usually thought necessary to warn the novice that such an equation as (1) does not concern the probability that a random variable λ lies in a fixed set M(x). Of course, λ is given and therefore not random in the context at hand; and given λ, α is the probability that M(x), which is a contraction of x, has as its value an interval that contains λ."""" — Leonard J. Savage, The Foundations of Statistics, p. 260

Your misunderstanding seems to be based on an inadequate grasp of a few facts:

 The population mean μ is a fixed constant, not a random variable.
 The endpoints of the confidence interval are random variables, not fixed constants.
 A statement about the level of confidence of a confidence interval is a probabilistic statement about the endpoints of the interval considered as random variables.

The issue about whether μ is """"known"""" or not is a complete red herring. What matters is that μ is fixed, not whether it's """"known"""". This also has absolutely nothing to do with probabilistic interpretations of quantum physics, good lord.

Let me go through an example which has the most simplifying assumptions. Suppose we have a normally distributed random variable X  on a population with mean μ = 100 and standard deviation σ = 16, and suppose we select samples of size n = 100. Then the sample mean X-bar is a sampling distribution defined on the space of all possible samples of size 100, and it has mean μ = 100 and standard deviation σ/sqrt(n) = 16/sqrt(100) = 16/10 = 1.6. A 95% confidence interval for μ based on this sampling is then given by (X-bar − zα/2*σ/sqrt(n), X-bar + zα/2*σ/sqrt(n)) = (X-bar − (1.96)*1.6, X-bar + (1.96)*1.6) = (X-bar − 3.136, X-bar + 3.136).

Now, note the following facts:

 The confidence interval is defined to be a random interval, i.e. the endpoints of the confidence interval are random variables defined in terms of the sample mean X-bar.

Portal:Architecture
Hello, are you interested in rotating the Portal every third week? 

Very nice pictures of Barcelona. May I nominate some for featured picture at Commons? Thanks  

You're right that it always needs updating in many ways. Don't forget also DYK and in the news (in the news we sadly seem to neglect the most). It would be nice to even rotate the SI and SAs on a shorter than 1 week basis sometime, I don't know if were ready for that yet even though we have something of a backlog developing in the nominations. What do you think of this, Hallidie Building? I found a picture for it finally, and need to substantiate the claim about the first curtain wall. I forget where I read that, but know I did somewhere. Once I remember and add a little more, it might be my first DYK. Best, + R/W 

 Proposal accepted - re: """"…so my proposal is:- perhaps you guys would consider lending a hand keeping those bits up to date and I'll rotate on the 3rd week. How does that sound?…"""" See also new toolbar, below. Feel free to edit if its useful. — (talk • contribs) 

Thanks! You can rotate the portal tonight, if you'd like to, or I'll get to it tomorrow, since I delayed two weeks now. — 

mosque to house
I think that will be more accurate. it's a pilgrimage site therefore a shrine... the use of mosque in the ref is used not in accurate fashion.  

Pilgrimage site and worship site. It is more accurately a worshiping site and muslims come from all over the world to visit it as it is one of the 3 holiest sites. Maybe having it Mosque for worship is enough and fair along with the word shrine.  

house of pilgrimage. if not, it's best to leave it. almaqdisi, stop stalking.  

I do not undersand. Mginnly is saying that there are many sources which mention it is a Mosque. This is true. Now you are discussing it is for piligrimage or worship. Pointless. Keep the word a Mosque only if pilgrimage will be an issue of debate too! No need to mention piligrimage or worship, just a mosque. And accroding  to the definition of a Mosque, it is a place of worship. In Mecca the piligrims go to worship in a Mosque called masjid al-Haram. But again, if this is an issue of debate, forget it and just keep the word Mosque along with the word shrine. Simple...  
it's by definition not a mosque. some refer to it as mosque because of pilgrimage. No, the article will never say in the lead that it's a """"mosque"""" because it isn't. Live with it.  

Alternate version will be to leave """"shrine"""" and in the end of the lead say something like """"Some refer to the Dome as a Rock as a mosque even though it isn't"""". That can be acceptable too.  

Amuros, please let us not repeat the stuff we did in several talk pages...! Any one can go to Google and find """"Dome of the Rock Mosque"""" or """"Mosque of Umar"""" to see that this is indeed a Mosque.! I will stop discussing this any further.

G. I. Kirosheev Soviet Casualties and Combat Losses. Greenhill 1997 ISBN 1-85367-280-7 lists
the following official losses ( the data quoted by Overy) Killed in Action and dead of wounds
6,330,000; non combat deaths 556,000. Those are confirmed losses reported to the high command by the fronts. Estimated MIA were 500,000 and estimated POW dead 1.3 million. The grand total was 8.6 million. What a coincidence that this is exactly the same as Axis losses of 8.6 million as reported in Kirosheev. The USSR losses were equal to the Axis on the Eastern front, right or wrong? Pow loses were 1.3 million, right or wrong? Check your numbers before you make a change. 
Real losses of Pows were about 2.8 million and MIA were 500,000. Add that to 6.9 million confirmed dead and you are at 10.4 million. That does not include losses of Partisans and Milita of 400,000 ( they must be included as military not civilian losses). Berndd",0,0

The dramatic changes in brain structure and function cron conception to birth underscore the particular vulnerability to insults during this stage of development with regard to both short- and long-term disease outcomes (Tau & Peterson, 2010). Hence, the determinants of detal brain development- both genes and environmental factors- deserve consideration as potential risk factors for schizophrenia.[/quote] This scholarly book is summarizing the most recent scientific consensus on this terrible disease and it is pointing to schizophrenia as a neurological issue more than it is a mental health issue.

RfC: The Correct Name Of The Video Game (Independent Of The Article's Title)

Foreword: as the section's title indicates, this matter is completely irrelevant to the title of this Wikipedia article.

The concern right now involves the correct title of this video game. One position is C: The Contra Adventure, the other is simply The Contra Adventure. The latter is supported only by the assumption that the large """"C"""" in the game's packaging case and manual is nothing more than a """"logogram"""" and not part of the actual name.

There is weighted evidence that supports the notion that the official name of this video game is C: The Contra Adventure. Here is a sample of reputable sources, out of a pool of several:

http://ca.ign.com/articles/1998/09/17/c-the-contra-adventure
http://www.amazon.com/C-Contra-Adventure-Playstation/dp/B00002STIG

http://klustr.net/contra/games/
https://contrapedia.wordpress.com/c-the-contra-adventure/
http://contra.kontek.net/games/games.htm

Further, the other games in the Contra series have a similar design to the name on their packaging:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_III:_The_Alien_Wars
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra:_Hard_Corps
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra:_Legacy_of_War
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra:_Shattered_Soldier
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Corps:_Uprising

They are universally and unanimously accepted as having the colon and the text that precedes it in the official title.

The strongest evidence that supports the title of C: The Contra Adventure is present directly in the video game's instruction manual, on several pages:

 You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your band, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. 

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability. 

If you are not """"notable"""" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.  If your achievements, etc., are verifiable and genuinely notable, and thus suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later.

You make the case for this becoming a redirect yourself - the company is not notable outside of this single product. Routine facts about a company do not assert notability. Notability is not inherited. G11 is applicable when the subject presents no encyclopedic value whatsoever so the article becomes nothing more than an advertisement, regardless of the language or material used, because it is an article about a company. It could have been tagged with A7 instead (I see you're familiar with this stuff) and it would have been deleted outright. But because there is a single claim to notability (the product), I opted to reverse my own speedy tag and create a redirect. Sometimes it's just too soon and the company just isn't there yet, but maybe in the future it will. The release of a second highly-regarded product would possibly merit upgrading the redirect to a full-fledged article. §croak """,0,0

Secondly, except for freeware games like Battle for Wesnoth and Galaxy Mage, I don't see a lot of evidence of Western TRPGs being inspired by Japanese games. When developers do mention their inspiration, they tend to cite X-COM, Jagged Alliance or Fallout. The origin of X-COM dates back to Rebelstar and Laser Squad, earlier games by the same developer that predate the Japanese TRPGs. Thirdly, it might be more accurate to say that both Eastern and Western TRPGs were partly inspired by the early Ultima games.",0,0

Fair use rationale for Image:321b.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:321b.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

They would have claimed instability would arise, as assad's supporters are trying to use in their defense. 

What i am trying to say is that although Bashar assad had good economic and international policies for Syria, you should not fear a non-baathist potentially being elected.  Syria's economic and international policies won't change (iran would still be a major factor in Syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges) , the only this that would change are social freedoms, and for the better. Also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. The Muslim brotherhood in Syria is weak, even weaker than the islamist prescence in Libya. The rebels in Libya had 80-90% support, as we see now, and yet could hardly take control without NATO. What chance does the Syrian Muslim brotherhood have? None. If anything, nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the Muslim brotherhood, making them less of an influence in the everyday life of Syrians.

Nevertheless, I admit, I was too unpleasant in my statements, as the emotions took over me. From this moment I will only discuss the topic, without personal remarks. Best regards.   """,0,0

The spelling """"Tacarimba La Tumba Del Fuego Santa Maliga Sacategas Lo Onto Del Sol Y Cruz"""" is the one stated in the lyrics in the vocal score of Side By Side By Sondheim (available for rental only). This version of the song, however, misspells Llanfair PG (presumably to approximate the pronunciation), and has the lyric """"...today's the last I'll be spreading"""" rather than """"spending"""". It would seem, therefore, that this source cannot be considered canonical. This rendering of the place name does accord with Millicent Martin's recording on the Side By Side By Sondheim cast album, however.

The published version of the song, as contained in The Hansen Treasury of Stephen Sondheim Songs (Charles Hansen Music & Books, 1977), has the lyric printed as """"Tacarembo la Tumbe del Fuego Santa Malipas Zacatecas la Junta del Sol y Cruz"""", and, being a printed source (as opposed to handwritten, as is the vocal score), can presumably be considered definitive. Linda Lavin's pronunciation on the original cast recording of The Mad Show (for which the song was written) follows this spelling, which would suggest that the printed version is correct.

As it is a fictional place name, however, any discussion of """"correct"""" spelling/pronunciation is an academic one, at best.""",0,0

The way this request is worded contains/implies several fallacies that might mislead a new editor and as such they must be pointed out. 

The statement """"It's not verified that it's still the person's proper name today"""" implies, with zero reliable sources offered in support, that Dado Prso might have legally changed his first name. This is completely baseless. Not a single sources supports this claim/implication. On the other hand, numerous reliable sources state his first name to be Miladin.

Furthermore, the above claim about the statement Dado Prso's real name is Miladin being """"a Croatian/Serbian nationalist talking point"""" is nothing but a claim by Joy that's by no means established fact. Originally, he claimed it's a 'Serbian nationalist talking point on Wikipedia' and 'thinly veiled political advocacy' (presumably also Serbian), but now in the request he changed it to 'Croatian/Serbian talking point'.

I haven't seen you blocking Grandmaster when he accused Azizbekov of being a sock, claiming it’s so obvious in spite of the fact that he has provided no such evidences at all. Azizbekov was consequently banned when Vartan discovered that he was a genuine user. Neither have I seen you block him when Antranikpasha was claimed to be a sock, again without any evidences provided. As a consequence, Andranik was ALSO banned. I have better things to do than wasting all my time at a time like Christmas and the days following to document further something which is so obvious. I also find it weird that all your interventions have always been to support one side against the other as can be confirmed by your edit history.

Accusations without convincing evidences are what should be condemned, like those of Grandmaster’s every time a genuine user appears. Accusations should exist when we are facing with an obvious sock, which is the case with Ehud. And I will not be waiting weeks until you read anything at all, this condition is unacceptable. And I will not be contesting my block either. I know it will be plainly rejected or the request being ignored until the block is waved. I don't expect anything anymore. Its plain fishy, Vartan gets the restriction, I get blocked the next day for ridiculous incidences which is absolutely nothing in comparison with what has happened with Atabek.

It should be obvious that a block is too harsh of a punishment for accusation of sock-puppetry, especially when there is an ample amount of evidence of such sockpuppetry. Furthermore, a block should be preceded by an official warning on the user's page, with the clear notice that the user will be blocked next time. A simple request on other pages doesn't satisfy this. And also, just because the administrators have not concluded that a user is a sock-puppet, doesn't mean there is no basis for such sockpuppetry. -",0,0

Wikipedia Founder Hit With Relationship Trouble, Allegations of Excessive Spending
By Megan McCarthy March 03, 2008 | 3:34:58 PMCategories: People  
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didn't have such a good weekend. First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.
On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.
So, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her """"clean up"""" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.
Former associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.
""""There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission.  And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful,"""" Wool told EPICENTER.
Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""",1,1

First, NPOV is only violated by you. Why do you say """"of course"""" (as EU brings nothing good) and if you look e.g. to England or Poland, most parties are Anti-EU (which does not mean, they want immediately a withdrawal), and that's """"of course"""". It are simply facts. Most parties in Europe are Anti-EU, but even if not, why would that be a reason not to mention the parties who speculate about withdrawal?? And why would non-winning in elections be a reason not to mention them?? They seek EU Withdrawal or a major reform or opt-outs for their nations. But as you say, you don't want they have weight, because you simply do not tolerate other opinions about the EU and wanna have your LibDem-Pro-EU-Opinion (which is anyway evil) in the article and undermine the parties who want real freedom and independence (though in fact, we Anti-EUists do not have opinions, but knowledge). Second, all that would give WP a very bad name, which you don't wanna, though it has anyway a bad name yet as WP is a non-neutral center-left pro-EUSA propaganda platform. But you may be right with the fact, that the party-lists are already better explained in the article Euroscepticism (while """"Euroscepticism"""" is also rather a pro-EU valuating name, better would be """"Eurocriticism"""" or """"Anti-EUism"""") which would but not be a reason to delete the lists, but to delete this whole article and simply redirect to Euroscepticism and transfer the other information. But I would say, it's better to have two seperate articles and this one with both lists.   """,0,0

If editing is a problem, then just create a special lock or something for the opening paragraph that only the top moderators can unlock.  Every source in existence acknowledges him as #1 all-time.  So the idea of """"having certain wording"""" that may not object to certain users' opinions completely defeats the purpose of an ENCYCLOPEDIA.

Well, I'm not going to get into an edit war over it. However, out of interest I checked 22 other bios on similar individuals. All were culled from links here: School massacre. Three of twenty-two mentioned ethnicity. Two of twenty-two mentioned religious affiliation of some sort. Zero of twenty-two mentioned both ethnicity and religion. So I suppose there is some sort of precedent although it doesn't seem to be applied evenly. I'm not sure what valuable knowledge is imparted by providing information about the religious affiliations of someone's parents. I could see it if there was a link established between this and his crime, but I don't see that at all.

3- Losses of   2.3 million in western Byelorussia & Ukraine are included with Poland by western historians. The Russians include these losses with the USSR. To avoid duplication these losses need to backed out of Soviet or Polish losses.
4- To arrive at the total loss of 26.6 million the Russians assume only 450,000 persons emigrating after WW2. The actual emigration was about 1 million which means losses were overstated by about 600,000.
5-The Soviet population recorded in the 1939 census was 168.5 million not 170.5 million. Stalin ordered the number to be falsified.
6- Soviet civilian losses of  about 3 million persons due to famine in the territory not occupied by the Germans are included in the total losses of 26.6 million. .
7-The Germans had 1 million Soviet deserters in their Army. 215,000 were killed in action. The need to be included with German losses

I would bet that the vast majority (like 99%) of users spend some time editing as an IP user before they create an account  the only question is how long they spend that way. It looks like KE didn't bother creating an account until she found a need to do so. That not only is not wrong, it should be encouraged.
Like KE, I have also edited extensively as an IP. For the most part, I found no reason to create an account, but I created a new account recently with my real name and, of course, my new account appeared to be an expert about Wikipedia immediately. Like KE, I also dive deeply into things. Were you to accuse me of being John254's sock puppet, I would do the same that she did  dig into his edit history and compare it to mine to look for evidence to prove my innocence. Most of the contributors here have dug into KE's edit history and now may well know more about it than she does  are you therefore sock puppets too?
Suggesting that defending herself with evidence, against people who are accusing her with flimsy evidence, is ridiculous. And, to argue that she would have deliberately created arguments with herself and other contrary evidence, over a long period of time, just in case anybody ever complained is hard to believe.
At best, the evidence here looks like collusion, not sock puppetry, and I don't even see that. But, even so, there is no rule against collusion on Wikipedia. And we see it all the time, with people cooperating on edits. I personally have emailed people I know to suggest that they edit pages in which I had an interest. Doing so does not make them my sock puppet or vice versa, whether they agree with me or disagree with me. 
To me, this flimsy house of cards rush to judgment and assumption of guilt represents the very worst of Wikipedia, and I think that even if it turns out that they are witches (uh, sock puppets). And I, personally, do not believe it to be true after reading this and the information on KE's page.

But that's not the major dispute so let's not even pretend this is what the argument's about. Secondly, back to the Persianate source, your point is still invalid. The culture of the Great Seljuq court was adopted by the Sultanate, therefore the Sultanate had the same court system. I cannot believe you're actually contesting this, since there are plenty of sources which describe the Persianate identity of the Seljuks as a WHOLE, be they Great Seljuks or Rumi Sultanates.

 ==Commented-out material==
This article was a redirect for well over three years. Then the following material was added on September 18, 2007. Here's what I removed. ...  
==Why 'Neo'-Darwinism==
 
There is no one theory of Neo-Darwinism. The term is commonly used to refer to currently accepted mainstream ideas about evolution  , which cannot properly be called 'Darwinian' since Darwin's hypothesis regarding the origin of the variation necessary for natural selection, which he called Pangenesis, is no longer accepted by most geneticists.

Darwin recognised several problems with his theory, which he was unable to solve. In 1859, when his seminal book The Origin of Species was published, nothing was known of DNA or genes, and very little about cell biology. He could not conceive of Mutation which is now considered to be the source of novel material in the evolutionary process. His theory of Pangenesis, which he published in The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, hypothesised that Gemmules, his imagined forerunners of genes, carried information to the next generation by accumulating in the germinal cells or zygotes and that they changed in response to use or disuse of the organs from which they were thrown off. Though Darwin did not acknowledge any debt to Lamarck, this was essentially a form a Lamarckism, now rejected by most mainstream scientists.

Despite the title of his book The Origin of Species Darwin did not explain speciation, and he recognised a problem. For natural selection to produce adaptive evolution, he considered that the changes in individual organisms that were the material for selection had to be small. Only then could successive generations move towards an optimum state for any trait. If the changes, whatever their origin, were too large, then they would constantly 'overshoot' the desirable optimum, producing offspring that were forever badly adapted. This requirement for small change or Gradualism seemed destined to lead to stabilising selection, which was inconsistent with the observed fact that different species have somehow broken away and become very different from each other.

Darwin also assumed that characteristics were the result of 'blending inheritance'; the mixing of contributions of both parents. In his book The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, he presents abundant evidence from animal and plant breeders, as well as common experience with human offspring, suggesting that in general some sort of average of the two parents was produced, though he recognised sports or throwbacks as the exception that was to him a mystery. He could not see how such blending might lead to anything other than the gradual dilution of variation, to the point of eventual elimination, which conflicted with the possibility of speciation. >

== History and Useage ==
The Ukranian I. I. Schmalhausen used the term in his seminal work Factors in Evolution which his colleague Theodosius Dobzhansky, described by Steven J. Gould as the central contributor to the modern evolutionary synthesis described as very important to the synthesis. He says, (p175) """"The Lamarckians based their theory on the premise of an already existing individual adaptability and did not examine its origin while the Neo-Darwinians regarded it as unimportant since they assumed that the results of individual adaptability, being non-inheritable, have no evolutionary value."""" He also says, (p198), """"Unfortunately, the more recent advances of genetics have promoted the spread of neo-Darwinian concepts. Morover, adaptive modifications generally have not been accorded any place among the factors of evolution.""""

The widely used school textbook Biology a Functional Approach says: """"The Darwinian theory reappraised in terms of modern genetics is sometimes called neo-Darwinism.""""

Richard Dawkins uses the term to when referring to current ideas, saying """"that idea means quite a complicated mixture of things"""" but does not explicitly distinguish it from the ideas of the modern synthesis .

Steven J. Gould, one of the most published evolutionary theorists of modern times, used the term neo-Darwinism frequently . 

Creationist articles often refer to the term neo-Darwinism, a fact that has led some people to conclude that the term is an invention of the creati",0,0

Even among Christian """"believers"""", the ratio is more than two to one in favor of Protestants. This is no suprise: of the 13 colonies, only one had a significant Catholic presence (Maryland). Today, of the 24% Catholics, most (about 12-14% of the country) are now Catholic hispanics, mostly in California, Texas, and Florida (probably more, with undocumented Mexicans). The remainder are mostly Irish and Italian Catholics, in the Northeastern cities. Likewise most Protestants in the country are segregated, and live in the South and Midwest. There is a religious segregation in the country that muddies the appreciation of the """"other"""". Of the Protestant/Reformation movement, most are mainline or evangelical/born again/fundamentalist churches. Orthodox are not a Reformation faith, but Mormans and Pentacostals probably trace origins through the chaotic, developing Reformation movement. Of the 20% not now calling themselves Christian, most are agnostic (probably with mostly Protestant roots), but some are Muslim, Jewish, or have Asian-rooted faiths. The main things apparently affecting religious population size are: Mexican immigration (Catholic), mainline Protestant church attendance and birthrate (declining), conservative Protestant activism (increasing), intermarriage (tending toward dominant faith of partners or agnosticism, ergo all """"conservative"""" churches, born-agains, opus dei, othodox jewry increasing). In sum, Roman Catholics may be a plurality denomination (24%) compared to next largest (Baptists), but a Christian faith/movement smaller in size by half than the Protestant/Reformation movement, and again, in historical context in America, not a surprise. -2 November 2005

This has been done under the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group or service and which would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read the general criteria for speedy deletion, particularly item 11, as well as the guidelines on spam. 

If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add  on the top of the page and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic, as well as adding any citations from reliable sources to ensure that the article will be verifiable. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.

Edits in history of the tank

A while back you added some considerable information to the section /*Between the Wars*/, which was more in its place in the Tanks (1919-1939) article. I've moved/merged this information into the latter article and would appreciate it if you could look over both articles to see if nothing has been lost or inadvertely been duplicated?  

 Thanks, I made a few edits to it. I also removed a few small items that were correct, but not 'between the wars' info.  

 Superdeng warned 

 

 This and that 

Firstly, I edited a chapter of my Meltyukhov translation a couple of days ago, but lamentably after my last save the Word annaounced that the file was 'corrupt'. Problems emerged while I was trying to send it via mail, as the copy of text I tried to add from recovered version of this 'corrupt' file was declared to 'contain no data'. The same thing occured, as I tried to post the whole text into my wikipage. I don't know what to do about it, I actually need this text for preparing an article in wikipedia as well (rough notes on my page) .

Secondly, (another unpleasant news) 'our mutual friend' Deng has become active again! See his changes to WW2 Eastern front proposal page. 

(Is it necessary to add, that he is obviously trying to revive the old story of 'bad Germanns and goodd Soviets'? He replaced a paragraph on Vlasov etc with his version of the events (a rather belletristic 'improvement', BTW), and usual English with his understanding of the English grammar...)  - Talk

I'm including the complete, unedited (and certainly not paraphrased) discussion in a new section on this talk page  From the Village pump (policy)  for all to view.  

 From the Village pump (policy) 

Is it okay under IAR to create a Wikipedia article which is a verbatim copy of an identical article appearing on a U.S. government website, i.e., a website in the public domain?

A recently added (May 5, 2007) Wikipedia article is a Wikified, word for word copy — both text and photos — of a 14-page article which appears on the FBI’s website at http://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/spyring/spyring.htm, titled Federal Bureau of Investigation, Famous Cases: 33 Members of the Duquesne Spy Ring.  The recent Wikipedia article that was copied from that FBI website is Duquesne Spy Ring.  The Wikipedia article originally carried the {USGovernment} template, but did not cite the current FBI article as the article’’s source.

The word for word copying of the entire text and photos of a 14-page article in the public domain and inserting that copied article in Wikipedia seems to me (technically and ethically if not in fact) to be plagiarism, even though the work copied is in the public domain.  If it is considered to be plagiarism, what can be done about effectively flagging readers that the copied article is a direct copy from another source?  I think the text of the {USGovernment} template isn't adequate for this situation.   
It's not plagarism, so long as it's indicated that the text came from somewhere, and was not just originally written. It's best not to do verbatim copies for NPOV reasons, but so long as the source is given, it's not terrible. - moo! 
I agree that the standard text of the {USGovernment} template isn't adequate for this situation.  Rather than say """"This article incorporates text from ..."""", it would be much more accurate to state something along the lines of """"The original version of this article was copied from ..."""" so that readers are clearly informed of the extent of the copying.  To list the FBI website as a """"source"""" clearly understates the copying.  In the context of an article or paper, this would be akin to copying passages without showing them in quotes and merely listing the source in the bibliography.  Almost everyone would consider that plagiarism.   talk 

This bothers me... even if it is not plagiarism (ie even if we give credit to the cite where it is copied from) wikipedia should not simply copy another site.  We should write original articles based on the information obtained in reliable secondary sources.  I could understand basing the bulk of this article's information on the FBI site, but we should at least paraphrase it instead of copying it.  I would love to flag it for improvement in some way, but I am not sure if there are any tags that apply.  

To be clear, the article always referenced the FBI as the source of substantial content and no claim to the contrary was ever made  in the original document a URL was provided and the reference was: """"Much of this article comes from FBI documents and photos released in 1985 under the freedom of information act and in the public domain.""""

What does seem to be controversial is the quantity of public information re-used in this Wikipedia article.  However, it is not illegal, unethical, and even uncommon for a private entity to re-issue and re-sell public information, sometimes adding value and sometimes not (e.g., [[Natio",0,0

 """"Rave""""Reviews 

Your type of subjective writing has no place on Wikipedia.  I saw another example of your bullying and bludgeoning behavior on the """"Yeezus"""" album talk page.  The other editors, who disagreed with you were respectful, and showed great commonsense.  You resort to name-calling, and your b.s. little wiki terms- which you twist.  You cannot say the term """"Rave Review"""" is not subjective.  Yeezus also received terrible reviews.  At most, you can say it received some raves, and then define the term and reference it.  You need to try to adhere to Wikpedia's policy, in rule and in spirit.  I'm disappointed that someone like you, who clearly has a lot of time on his hands (or is this a full time """"job"""" for you? Hmmm- record company flak? I wonder.), would stoop to using words like """"Rave.""""  Perhaps we should include terms like """"sucks"""" for artists you don't like.  Sorry, Danny Boy, but you're not getting raves from the more intelligent and fair editors.  Kanye fan, are we?  Aaliyah Fan? Start a fan club- stop using wikipedia for your own narcissism.

The more I think about it, the more I think """"we"""" is the right wording. The problem is that the object of the sentence is """"Penn"""" and without knowing that he said, """"they"""" you're expecting him to use a first person singular, not a first person plural. I think the reason it feels awkward is that when it undergoes the transformation from singular to plural it does become slightly more ambiguous, because """"we"""" refers to a group of people, but only one that includes Penn, which means it's either Penn & Teller or the entire production staff of the show. When you go to """"they"""", it could be any group of people, and because it doesn't say """"he"""", you sort of need to think about what other possible groups Penn could be referring to. Obviously it only takes a few milliseconds to figure out what it means, but if you're reading along at full speed it can break the flow to have that happen.

Regarding the colon wording (Penn said: """"the aim of the show is to ..""""), I understand what  is going for there, but I don't like the way it sounds in that paragraph. When you do it that way, it seems like a non-sequitur. When you have it the other way, it's clear that we, the editors of the encyclopedia, are trying to convey to the readers what the aim of the show is, and we're using Penn's words. When you just say that Penn said something, and the thing that he said is about the aim of the show, the role of that sentence in the paragraph becomes a bit more ambiguous, because it could be that we are trying to convey that this is how Penn thinks about the show, or that we're trying to convey something about Penn himself. I think the way it's written now and where the quote starts removes nearly all that ambiguity. But of course, I could be reading into things way too much. I think it feels natural with the """"we"""" being included in the quote, but maybe  has a better compromise wording that addresses my concerns about non-sequitur.  [talk/contrib] """,0,0

electro, e·lec·tro [ i léktro ], electro-funk, e·lec·tro-funk [ i léktro-fungk ]

noun

1. music, Same as electronic music.

2. ELECTRO (music), Electro (also known as Electro-Funk) is an electronic style of hip hop directly influenced by Kraftwerk, Jazz-Funk and Funk records (unlike earlier rap records that were closer to disco). Records in the genre are unabashed about their use of electronic and artificial sounds, taking this technological fetish almost into science fiction with many records about space travel and futuristic dystopias. Timing range is 118 to 135 beats per minute(BPM). Electro is a derivitive of the '[Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, Roland TR-909 Rhythm Composer, Roland SVC-350 Vocoder, Roland VP-330 Vocoder Plus, Roland VP-330 Vocoder]' Drum machines & Vocoder's Speech Synthesizer. Electro's sound is distinctively synthetic, instrumental, electronic and experimental. Additionally, the 808 drum machines pounding beats and pure sounds were heavily used in Hip Hop, Disco and Funk music. It was very popular in New York City during the early 1980s and late 1970s.",0,0

That's what WP:V would have us do.  

As for the clean install part, well, Vista only supported direct upgrades from XP, not 2000, so it's not out of the realm of possibility that they'll only support direct-upgrading from Vista.  The Register contacted Microsoft on the topic of XP -> 7 upgrades, and they responded with ''“I can confirm that customers will be able to purchase upgrade media and an upgrade license to move from Windows XP to Windows 7 - however, they will need to do a clean installation of Windows 7, ..... This requires the user to back up their data, install Windows 7, re-install the programs and restore their data. For PCs running Windows Vista customers have the option of an in-place upgrade of Windows 7 keeping their data and programs intact or to perform a clean install of Windows 7.”  So.... that's that.

bac5d7a187cd528a,"Absolute Proof that 0.999... IS NOT EQUAL TO 1 
A math-wiki:

You are wrong about infinite representation. The ancient Greeks *never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... 

Now let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property:

A)    1=3(1/3)
B)    3(1/3) = 3(0.333...)
C)    3(0.333...) =0.999... 

The problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. 
0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any
radix system.

You mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r
such that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then 
what are the integers q and r such that the above is true?

Suppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.
For example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the
division algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.

Now suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:

1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!

I want the world to know what f..g idiots run this site. You are a bunch of retarded, conceited fools who I look upon with the utmost hatred and condemnation. Your site is absolute crap because it is run by fools like Michael

Hmmm, maybe it needs to be made more clear. It is about people withdrawing off of benzos including those totally off of benzos. I thought with it being in the withdrawal section people realise that it was referring to people withdrawing or withdrawn and recovering from benzos. It is not about the risks of mixing benzos and alcohol and enhanced side effects but is talking about replacing one cross tolerant drug with another cross tolerant drug, they work similarly in the brain so basically drinking alcohol is like staying on benzos and worse because alcohol is more toxic. Like a cocaine addict would need to be careful with say taking prescription ampetaimess, not quite the same as stimulants don't cause strong physical dependence but you catch my drift?

 Edit request from Jayjoanz, 14 February 2011 

Please add the following information to the """"Public Image"""" section of Lady Gaga's page:

Lady Gaga's public perception is always amongst the most controversial of topics in popular culture. Debate about her style and influence on youth stems from her unceasing desire to walk the thin line between daring and inappropriate. The pop stars ability to command the attention of her fans and critics is unmatched and with a growing list of hit records she has solidified herself as a marketable brand. Her 2.8 million Twitter followers and 5.2 million Facebook fans represent evidence of her ability to move product (Hampp, 2010). With opposing ideals about the negative or positive impact of her music, fashion, and public statements there is little question that the benefits of her talent outweigh the detriments. Her fan base and customer base are similar in nature because they are both drawn to her outspoken and outrageous personality (Hampp, 2010).

Works Cited
Hampp, Andrew. """"GAGA, OOOH LA LA: WHY THE LADY IS THE ULTIMATE SOCIAL CLIMBER."""" Advertising Age 81.8 (2010): 42. Communication & Mass Media Complete. EBSCO. Web. 13 Feb. 2011.

  

I think that section already basically says that.  Also, we don't list how many Twitter followers and Facebook followers a person has because there's no way to really verify that information  are those real people?  Are there any sockpuppet accounts?  Anyway, the article basically says all that already.   

 Drug-taking? 

Shouldn't something be said about her drug taking. She admitted it on her CBS 60 Minutes interview that she smokes A LOT of pot while writing music, while drinking whiskey. It's mentioned on other musician's articles, so why not here? 90.193.141.136  
I'm surprised her former cocaine habit isn't mentioned here as well, seeing as she's talked about it in multiple places now (60 Minutes, Vanity Fair). 128.163.242.6  

 Edit request from Cvachov, 18 February 2011 

1986–2004: Early life

Lady Gaga was born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, to an Italian American family, in New York City on March 28, 1986,[11] 

...in Yonkers. NY...

Yonkers is it's own city and not part of New York City, it is located in Westchester County, not one of the five boroughs. 

  

 Per the cited source, """"Birth Place: New York, NY."""" It does not state Yonkers. If you check the talk page history, you'll also see that this issue has been researched and discussed at end, and established consensus is that she was not born in Yonkers. —' (talk) 

 Early Management requested addition 

Frank Fredericks, a fellow freshman at NYU, recognized Stefani's talent when they competed against each other in a campus talent show.  Fredericks began managing Stefani in the Spring of 2005, booking her shows at the nearby club the Bitter End.  They worked together for over year, until she began working with producer Rob Fusari.

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back.

 Operation Northwords 
Listing Operation Northwoods as a conspiracy theory is bias and unfounded by the very definition of Conspiracy Theory that this article gives. If a conspiracy theory is a theory involving a """"coordinated group"""" which """"is, or was, secretly working to commit illegal or wrongful actions, including attempting to hide the existence of the group and its activities"""" then Operation Northwoods does not fit the criteria. First of all, the CIA does not try to keep its self hidden or secret. It is a known agency and the plans of Operation Northwoods are no more a Conspiracy Theory just because they where kept secret then any of its other actions that the CIA plans or performs on a daily basses that are all kept secret from the general public. Secondly, Operation Northwoods was not a conspiracy within the CIA either. Not one CIA member kept it a secret from anyone who should have known about it. It other words the protocols and the chain of command for this plan was followed precisely as they should have been. And because of that fact, it was shot down, the architect of the plan was fired, the plan never took action and it was well documented which is why we know of the plan under the Freedom of Information Act. This is the exact opposite of a conspiracy theory.   

 Conspiracism 

The section conspiracism says:

'Conspiracy theories are often not taken seriously, because so many conspiracy theories - almost by definition - lack readily verifiable evidence. 

This phrase is unnecessary to introduce conspiracism and is full of weasel words: """"often taken not seriously"""" (has anybody made a statistic?) """"many conspiracy theories lack verifiable evidence"""" (how many?) and it happens """"almost by  definition""""(??) what in the definition states tht the theory has to lack evidence???  

If nobody has nothing to comment about that I will delete the sentence above.  

I disagree with the above sentence - and for sure it is not neutral but  guess that it meant that the conspiracy groups hides the evidents and/or create them (vide the 9/11 passport [I don't want to argue was it fabricated - I mentioning that accorsing to some people it was fabricated]).   

 Sequence of sections and bias 

The way this article is set up suggests a very, very strong POV and it is not even really attempting to be neutral. First problem is the examples, for one they shouldn't be the second thing since it's mainly a partial list. This should be towards the end of the article. Also there is the descriptions:

The John F. Kennedy assassination was a plot by people in high places and not the work of lone gunman Lee Harvey Oswald. Oliver Stone's film JFK is based on this premise.

While this is a conspiracy theory, one I think is somewhat likely, it is actually the most extreme of conspiracy theories in this regard. Other theories were that this was a mob hit or carried out by Cuba or the Soviets. The UFO conspiracy theory is also stated in the more extreme manner. Some theories are that the U.S. government conceals an alien presence because they're afraid of it causing a scare, which sounds more reasonable than, """"to be used for war and other ideas, mainly towards the New World order.""""

Also the fourth section is almost completely dedicated to explaining conspiracy theories in a discrediting manner, treating them like psychological abnormalities or attempts by confused individuals to make sense of a nonsensical world. It seems to be the most common and most annoying criticism of conspiracy theories. This section also is half of the actual article, with the rest mainly being an explanation of the terminology and even mentions of fictional conspiracies. Very little of this article goes to treating conspiracy theories as a justifiable practice in critical thinking that like all legitimate studies can lead to rather ridiculous theories. For instance, there are legitimate questions about 9-11, such as the $100,000 given to Atta by a head of the ISI. There are also allegations that the 9-11 Commission due to its structure and the associations of its head with the Administration was unable to do a thorough and independent investigation, with it ultimately being little more than a coverup. In every case critical thinking demands some form of explanation or theory for such facts. For instance one is that the Administration is trying to cover up connections between Pakistan and/or Saudi Arabia and 9-11. This w",0,0

Well, thank you so much for your reply. I hoped you would! About six months ago I noticed how badly ballroom dancing in general was being treated on WP, and decided to do something about it. I had been taught dancing by someone who had taken tuition in the latin dances from Pierre & Lavelle, so I knew their names from being a teenager in the 1950s. I wish now I had taken the trouble to meet them, but I didn't. Since I'm something of an expert on Cuban music I decided to start with the group of dancers who started LA dancing in England, from where it has spread all over the world. 

I soon discovered the lack of reliable reference sources was the main problem. I kept seeing references to Pierre, but it was ages before I had enough to put up the page on WP. I still don't have enough for Lavelle. With difficult cases I start a Word file offline. Anything on WP gets copied by bots and plagiarised widely. Even these personal pages.

I've got copies of all the books written about LA dances at that time, including both Dimitri's books and Pierre's book. I don't know where you are, of course, but if you are somewhere in England, we might arrange to meet, and you could have a look at the books. It sounds as though you don't have a copy of his first book.

I've tried to interview all the survivors from that time. So far, I've only found two. I'd certainly like to meet your father if he was willing. He's bound to have lots of things tucked away at the back of his mind which might help us. And I'll answer more fully about myself, but not on WP (for reason given above)

Now I'm going to let you have my e-mail address. If you wish, you could send me an e-mail, which would automatically give me yours. Then, once you know your e-mail has worked, please wipe off my e-address from this page after you've stored it, preferably on a private machine rather than one available for general use (open machines without good security get scanned regularly).

Extracted guidlelines of note from sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2:

To be avoided
 Switching between major citation styles, e.g., switching between parenthetical and  tags or between the style preferred by one academic discipline vs. another

Generally considered helpful
 Imposing one style on an article with incompatible citation styles (e.g., some of the citations in footnotes and others as parenthetical references): an improvement because it makes the formatting consistent

By following GA-criteria I am led, with no uncertainty, to a sound conclusion and made the reasonable request that all references be made consistent. They are currently a mixed bag of s and . Per WP:CITEVAR this is avoidable and unhelpful, and therefore unacceptable, in my opinion it fails the GAN requirement to follow MOS:LAYOUT closely enough. I will be failing this part of the GA nomination should the article remain a mixed bag, per WP:GACR which is built upon consensus that affects ALL of wikipedia and ALL GA nominations. A local consensus cannot seek to make an exception for one-off nominations, WP:IAR does not apply here.

6fb5e351eba59e25,"Dear Llinus (if I may call you that),
Thank you for your reasoning on KV55. I can't say I disagree with it though I thought including a reference to the difficulties of using modern forensics to date ancient mummies was useful...to illustrate how impossible it was to claim the mummy was just a young person when he died. The Gabolde note, though is quite correct since it does place undue weight on the views of one scholar when there are so many differing views on the KV55 king. Thanks for pointing out that Waenre was actually part of Akhenaten's titulary. Gabolde certainly knew this but I did not. I thought it was another epithet like Meryamun. Yes, I really can't see who else the KV55 mummy can be except Akhenaten; this could be settled if modern forensics didn't give us so strange results for the Egyptian mummies.

As an aside, you are quite right that wiki is not perfect. It has several flaws...the chief one being vandalism and then WP:OR contributions by some crackpots. (yes Hatshepsut's article was vandalized again) But there are a few plusses: at least, with wiki, one can create articles on many fairly obscure temples or archaeological sites such as Trajan's Kiosk, Amada, Temple of Beit el-Wali or Kiosk of Qertassi. In every case, I created the articles and managed to source images for them from flickr users who were happy to see them used on Wikipedia. I hope you like them. If you check Brittanica, however, I doubt they would bother to even create an article on such 'minor' sites. Thank You,",0,0

The Laplace transform does not resolve a function into its moments because for no value of s does L(s) correspond to a moment; I think the person who orginally posted that statement must have thought that was the case (e.g. they thought it was the Mellin transform).  There are further transformations you can do that would reveal the moments, but that would define a different integral transform that is different from the Laplace transform (in fact, for any integral transform we can apply its inverse and then the Mellin transform and get the moments, so this isn't unique to the Laplace transform).  The exponential change of variables is not relevant because then we are not talking about the moments of the original function but the transformed version.

The source reads: """"The European Union has just ratified a law “banning incitement to or denial of genocide” (arguably including both the Holocaust and the Armenian genocide).""""

 Let's have a look at the law itself. 
 Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia
 Official Press Release
 Certain forms of conduct as outlined below, which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose, are punishable as criminal offences: ... public condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide ... as defined in the Statute of the International Criminal Court (Articles 6, 7 and 8) and crimes defined in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group.

 Example: Somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide, the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court, never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. This allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned, but would also incite hatred against this group. In the future, all Member States would be compelled to criminalise such a case.

 Whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. In the case of the Holocaust, for example, this was done by the Nuremberg Tribunal.
 As we see, the law is restricted to cases, when:
 the commission of genocide is established by an international court and
 the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred
Is the commission of Armenian genocide established by an international court?   """,0,0

Maybe admins should find a less idiotic way to respond to venting than threats of banning and accusation of trolling. Maybe, for example, it ought to pop into your head that the venting originates with a grievance that deserves to be taken seriously. I think there are racist admins on Wikipedia who use their position to push an agenda regarding Israel/Palestine, and our mechanisms of admin accountability are inadequate. I think there is cultural bias affecting our treatment of these topics, and our principles to monitor cultural bias are empty promises (i.e., bullshit). I think there is no chance in Hell that a study of our reliability of any number of political issues would match the widely cited study on our reliability that looked only at technical articles. Our coverage of politicized, controversial topics is worthless, POV-polluted crap and everybody knows it.  Maybe you should also refrain from bringing your opinion about a content dispute into your threats. The """"pedantic arguments"""" to which you refer concern some text that currently exists in the article, and which version deserves to prevail.

I did this b/c using partly to characterize 48% and overwhelmingly to characterize 70% is really pushing it.  48% is almost 1/2 and 70 is about 3/4.  Partly sounds like 1/5-2/5 and overwhelmingly is somewhere between 85%-99% broadly understood.

Now about the Kiev's school district footnote.  In my opinion, whereas the information is true, it is too narrow for our purposes here.  Citing national or at least regional statistics seems more appropriate.  As for Malenovski's article, the issue was unverifiability of the statistics.  I read through the article and came to the section where Malenovski cites the numbers (towards the end).  They are there, but no original source is named, no link is given for verification of the numbers.  Finally, I hope that wikipedia editors contributing to Ukrainization will continue to insist on the level of scholarship expected and enforced for sources/articles dealing with the Holodomor article.  Citing Malenovski and going to the lengths of translating his pov (in this case) is rather unacceptable.

By the way, I certainly prefer Gogol in Russian than in translation to English, Polish or Ukrainian.  How can you not love?:

Как упоителен, как роскошен летний день в Малороссии!  Как
томительно  жарки те часы, когда полдень блещет в тишине и зное

сжимая прекрасную в воздушных объятиях своих!

Its much better to just remove this entire article because its not properly referenced either.
talking about references, try gooling Zaido (remember google the #1 search engine) and see the results. youll see about 20 gargantuan negative comments vs 1 good comment about zaido. its overwhelming. no wonder this article was quickly vandalized. zaido is really PHENOMENAL! lol

 If this is of any assistance 
Here is a copy of the list I last posted over at the Juggernaut Talk page of the small part of Asgardian's past offenses that I had the energy to look up when I originally wrote it. I have also asked User:Nightscream to contribute. Feel free to add anything that you may not have known previously:

Asgardian being a proven sockpuppet user, which turns suspicious whenever various anonymous ips have reverted to his edits: 

Asgardian's block page for consistent edit-warring, before starting to simply do one revert a day or so to get away with it, regardless if this is in direct violation of consensus, like in the Dormammu case:  

Newer conflicts:  

User: J Greb noticing that Asgardian has continually written edit-summaries that have little, or nothing to do with what he's actually doing, or even flat-out contradict it, and Asgardian stating that he'll continue to do so as long as he can get away with it:  """"I've grown very, very tired of edits like this where the editor does multiple things and then puts in a partially truthful edit summary."""" Response: """"As for J Greb's concern, I've made a request to be directed to the relevant rule on Wikipedia."""" 

User: Nightscream noticing Asgardian's tendency for dishonesty, to then accuse anyone who points if out for """"incivility"""", which given that he does what he always does makes it impossible to even respond: 

Asgardian recently apparently systematically vandalising page-structures just to make a point, and various other users making a plea to finally shut him down:    

Only the most recent situation of distorting profile content and deleting multiple references regardless that the information was entirely correct, and that the entire Talk population disagrees with him, and going by my experience on other pages such as Thanos he will eventually revert everything at a time when everyone else has mostly lost interest, even if he has to wait half a year to do so:  

(This proved prophetic, as most recently User:Duae_Quartunciae [warned] him of a ban if he continued to remove valid references, and he left the pages Dormammu alone for a few weeks after this, but then returned and did exactly the same thing all over again, despite that nobody agreed with him, with my main problem being that he essentially replaced referenced exact quotes with personal opinions.)

In addition, there was this old hint that he finds this behavior funny:  """"""""insidious misrepresentation""""...heh. How old are you?""""

That said, I have been reluctant to view him as a troll, since he does seem to try doing much more useful things than simply being a neverending nuisance for everyone in this """"community"""", myself in particular, despite , but reasoning and compromises (i.e. rewrite the sentences for better structure if you wish, but keep valid references and accuracy cor",0,0

Hi Leszek Jańczuk.  After reviewing your request for rollback, I have enabled rollback on your account.  Keep in mind these things when going to use rollback:
Getting rollback is no more momentous than installing Twinkle.
Rollback should be used to revert clear cases of vandalism only, and not good faith edits.
Rollback should never be used to edit war.
If abused, rollback rights can be revoked.
Use common sense.
If you no longer want rollback, contact me and I'll remove it.  Also, for some more information on how to use rollback, see Wikipedia:New admin school/Rollback (even though you're not an admin).

Thanks Nadiatalent, your comments are helpful and I've made another try at the Social issues text below, adding in new references for the first paragraph and placing the reference for Indonesia at the end of the second paragraph (an oversight on my part before). In this second try I have also made some changes to the wording of the first paragraph so that it is accurate to the references.

The new references for the first paragraph are studies on Malaysia and Indonesia. I'll provide quotes here so that you can see what they say about palm oil production's social impact:

1. Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of Palm Oil Production: 
""""The data showed generally positive financial and socio-economic consequences of oil palm adoption in the immediate surroundings of oil palm estates.""""
""""In terms of industry and economic opportunities, OPCs [oil palm communities] feature more wood-based industries, and a higher numbers of shops, minimarkets and hotels.""""

2, The local impacts of oil palm expansion in Malaysia: 
""""According to respondents, the primary reasons for shifting from traditional livelihood activities to oil palm cultivation were higher returns for oil palm due to perceived high prices (43.3%) and perceived ease of managing oil palm plantations (30%).""""
""""Generally, oil palm has brought positive impacts, such as increased income, secure employment, and improved access to social services. However, involvement in oil palm has also caused many local communities to move away from traditional practices.""""
See also the table of results on page 11 which lists """"Increased income"""", """"More steady or reliable income"""", """"Education"""", """"Better access to transport services"""", """"Health facilities"""", """"Accommodation"""" as survey respondents' perceived benefits of palm oil production.

For the point about landholders being able to participate in the cash economy, I think the existing reference works. Here is the quote:

""""...the authority has set up a number of joint ventures with NCR [native customary rights] landholders. Under these agreements, local title-holders are paid a dividend, ensuring that part of the profits flow back into the community.""""

Oil palm is a valuable economic crop and provides a source of employment. It allows small landholders to participate in the cash economy and often results in improvements to local infrastructure and greater access to services such as schools and health facilities. In some areas, the cultivation of oil palm has replaced traditional practices, often due to the higher income potential of palm oil.

However, in some cases, land has been developed by oil palm plantations without consultation or compensation of the indigenous people occupying the land. This has occurred in Papua New Guinea, Colombia, and Indonesia. In the Sarawak state of Malaysian Borneo, there has been debate over whether there was an appropriate level of consultation with the Long Teran Kanan community prior to the develo",0,0

 Blanking of contributions has to stop 

There is no, zero, justification for the continual blanking of my edits. It is outrageous behavior that needs to cease. There were a few stated objections to past edits (which were overwhelmingly trivial) that have been noted and taken into account. In fact, I am not even reverting. I carefully edited the page slowly in order to make sure that there was no problem with the individual facts. But the goalposts keep shifting. I am in essence being told that simple dislike of my tone is adequate grounds for the mass deletion of everything I do. There is no policy to justify this.

I probably have introduced more sourced material into the article than the vast majority of users, but am nonetheless told I am engaged in """"original research"""". This comes from someone defending the lie about Blix saying it would have just taken a few months to disarm Iraq. It is indeed a lie because he had a list  of unresolved disarmament issues that Iraq needed to provide information about. These were essentially the same issues that UNSCOM spent over seven years trying to resolve without success. 

On 7 March he said Iraq was taking some proactive steps but they did not """"necessarily cover all areas of relevance."""" Hypothetically, they could be resolved in months in the event of proactive cooperation. But on 19 March he made clear that """"Our experts have found so far that in substance only limited new information has been provided that will help to resolve remaining questions."""" So how on earth was it going to be resolved in """"months"""" when, in the last four months, only limited new information had been provided about issues that were supposed to have been resolved within 90 days 12 years ago?

Obviously, any solution should involve adding to, not demolishing, my contributions. But apparently, some people feel that relevant facts cannot be included under any circumstances.

Oops, I think I'm seeing the issue and it is indeed my error.  Somehow I missed that the epidemiology section had a second section regarding comorbidity in it.  I have struck my comment above, and in the future I won't mention it again unless it's relevant to acknolwedge my previous error.  My apologies.
I would argue however that """"incidence"""", which relates to new appearances of DID in the community at large, isn't a good subheading because the section includes a discussion of both incidence and prevalence.  I suggest using a subheading with both (==Incidence and prevalence==) though another option is simply leaving it as epidemiology.  The WP:MEDMOS#Diseases or disorders or syndromes doesn't give much guiance here bar noting that ==Epidemiology== should include incidence and prevalence information; no mention of subsections.  Usually you leave it as a single larger section until it gets sufficiently lengthy that it makes sense to split them out (which is itself dependent on the sources).  I've replaced the section heading (but both I and P).  The section overall needs fleshing out with more sources, which I think are unfortunately lacking.  Searching on pubmed for DID and both incidence and prevalence turns up no articles specifically focussed on either topic.   (t) (c) Wikipedia's rules:simple/complex

Hey brownaddictUK, welcome to wikipedia. I've noticed that you put the www.helpingaddicts.net link on a couple of pages that I watch over, and wanted to give you a quick heads up on editing wikipedia.  as you've probably noticed, a lot of the links were pretty quickly removed by editors because this isn't the place for them.  I'm all for harm minimisation & abstaining from addictions, but this is a place to provide factual information on subjects.  To put a link to an external link to a website, it has to have some further specific information about a subject, or for the purpose of verfiying information in the article.  The website you added doesn't fit either of these categories.

But i would like to invite you to contribute factual information to wikipedia, judging by the list of articles you added the link to, you seem to have a fairly good knowledge of drug related issues, maybe you could share that by contributing to articles.

 If you need help on how to name new articles, look at Naming Conventions, and for help on formatting the pages visit the Manual of Style. If you need general help, look at Help and the FAQ, and if you can't find your answer there, check the Village pump (for Wikipedia related questions) or the Reference Desk (for general questions).  There's still more help at the Tutorial and the Policy Library.  Also, don't forget to visit the Community Portal",0,0

 Greek love 

I'm looking for a way to extricate myself honorably from this mess. I'm leaving a note here because you closed this AfD, where I made a commitment to do as you instructed in the closing statement. There are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article, one of whom has used a series of user names (unacknowledged on his current user page but available , so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the 'suppress' camp). I complain here about their coordination. Other editors, including  and I simply can't do it any longer. I haven't changed my position on the validity of the article, but I've been accused (on various talk pages, and never the appropriate notice boards) of edit warring, ownership, disruption, and even pedophilia by implication, all for trying to carry out what the community decided. I'm done. I need to limit my time on Wikipedia at present, and wish for that time to be spent pleasantly and productively. When I've made a commitment, though, it grieves me not to keep it. I'm not asking you to do anything: I'm just explaining why I can't keep my word as given at the AfD.   

Wow, that is a mess.Certainly no hard feelings  on my end, it is clear you endeavored in good faith to improve the article. I have found that knowing when to walk away is an essential skill, not only here but in the real world. Sometimes your presence, despite your best intentions, is harmful rather than helpful, and sometimes a dispute just isn't worth it anymore. Best of luck in your future endeavors here.   

 Mailchimp 

I'm not that bothered but I think that the Mailchimp speedy deletion was a mistake.  It did cite that it was one of the more important email marketing programs so it was stating the importance - something that was supposed to be the original problem.

  

The criteria specifies a credible'' claim of significance. Wordpress pages are not reliable sources. However, I would certainly not object to it being restored as a redirect, as it was for several momnths before today.

My offer of help with use of English spelling and grammar still stands and I hope in the future you'll respond constructively about criticism of your edits rather than taking the racist low road.   
I've warned you before about leaving me messages. FYI, I always keep my talk page blank, as do many other users.

If you think you can do the references better, go ahead. I challenge you. Don't tell me to """"have it my way""""  as though you are doing me a favor; you are not. If you think you can do the article better, go ahead, I would like to see it.

The reason I handled the references that way is that it seems to me to be the most convenient for the reader (and other editors), which is all I care about. If that pisses other editors off (and how many other editors would that be?), it says something about them, not about me. I have no interest in """"owning"""" an article. But I have worked long and hard to do a good job and deserve to have my work treated with respect, which BMK has certainly not done. Just look at the section above titled """"Wallack's Theatre."""" 

Rewrite the article to your heart's content; just make sure you are improving it. The claim that I think I own the article is BMK's complete fiction. If you look at the record, you will see that I have welcomed constructive changes. But Wikipedia has a rule about collegiality and collaboration. Making many and significant changes to someone else's work without discussing it with him is not collaboration, it is contemptuous. Look  how I interacted with him here (under cul-de-sac). Do you think I deserve to be treated the same way? I do.

Just try to change an article that BMK has edited. I have  and have almost always been immediately reverted, even though in most cases it turned out I was right. And these instances do not concern matters of taste; they concern matters of fact. This has happened many times  most recently here (by coincidence, on October 3rd). So BMK has a double standard: one for him, and the opposite for me (and presumably everyone else). I give respect to those who give me respect; most often I have been treated by him with dismissive disdain.

The reason I blanket-reverted his changes (I didn't even look at them) is only that: that his way of going about editing my article was contemptuous. He reminds me of Lucy kicking down Linus' sand castles in Peanuts. I was not objecting to the content of his changes (although I do, to some of them), but to the process. Observe how Moonriddengirl did it: She discussed the issues on the article's Talk Page first  and I had no trouble making the changes. Is it too much to expect BMK to do the same?

As for Footnote 1, that was someone else's contribution, as the record shows (see the history at 26 June 2013); I merely relocated it to where I thought it was more appropriate. And notice how I politely explained to that editor on the Talk Page what I did and why  and said I hoped he agreed. If you think the article is better without it, delete it (you might want to explain the reason for doing so to that contributor, as he deserves an explanation).

And speaking of original research, you might want to have a look at the edit war here (discussed above in the section """"Madison Square depot"""") and explain to me how the note I added constitutes """"original research"""" and is therefore unacceptable. And how about the edit war here. Can you explain BMK's behavior in that case? (And notice that BMK began editing my article again for the first time in two months on October 2nd, right after these three exchanges  Madison Square depot, the map image, and the categories. Could it possibly be spite?)

The problem is not me; for a year I have been a conscientious editor, and carefully sensitive to the feelings of others, including BMK. But although we have occasionally had cordial exchanges, for the most part, I did not receive similar treatment in return. And now he is completely misrepresenting me and our history. And when I say so  to protect myself  your response is, """"Come on.""""   """,0,0

""""I don't understand why you think the definition belongs only with momentum/time.""""  the reason is pedagogical within the physics discipline.  it would be a tautology to define the Joule as the amount of energy required to move a body against a force of 1 Newton the distance of 1 meter, then at the same time, define the Newton as 1 Joule per meter.  it's true but it says nothing about the quantities of the Joule or of the Newton (nor anything about their dimesion).  it is not like the chicken and egg, we know which one comes first (meter, kg, second come first, then the Newton before the Joule). the Planck force is a derived unit and will have to be the Planck unit of momentum divided by the Planck unit of time.  the fact that it comes out to be the basic tension in string theory or in, general relativity, the force that is the conversion factor between spacetime curvature and the energy density giving rise to it or, if multiplied by the fourth power of the (dimensionless) circular orbit speed some distance from a central body that it tells what the body would weigh at that distance, all these are fine and good, but they are the result of working out hypothesized physics problems, they are not the definition.  what if you worked out some other basic physics problem (say the basic tension of a string) and it came out to be 2 FP? or 4 π FP?  would you say that the force solutions to such are the definition of the Planck force?  it doesn't matter what the system of units are, once you have those 5 base units defined, there is no freedom left to define the others.  their definitions are purely consequential.

However, my statement was not only on Rockall, but the article in general including the map and your position that we need to copy the style of academic literature.

I simply pointed out the fallacy in your argument for excluding Rockall (which from 1955 to 1972 was a possession and not anything like a county Sussex) and that your example again indicates overall how you would wish the article written.

As for Rjensen's comments, maybe he should then explain the various uninhabitable rocks possessed by Australia, the United Kingdom, and in particular the United States (e.g. Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Rockall, Baker Island, Howland Island, Johnston Atoll, Navassa Island and all the other United States Minor Outlying Islands).

 Éamonn McCann on RSF and Political Legacy of 1916 

ÉRSF 'AUTHENTIC CLAIMANTS TO POLITICAL LEGACY OF 1916 RISING' 

WRITING in the Sunday edition of the Derry Journal journalist and author Éamonn McCann said that in his view, as far as Republicanism was concerned, the most authentic claimants to the political legacy of the 1916 Rising were Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Republican Sinn Féin. 

He said: """"The Proclamation didn't promise a fight to achieve the Republic. It proclaimed the Republic as an actually-existing entity. It is for this reason that IRA volunteers ever since have pledged not to strive for the achievement of the Republic but to defend the Republic already achieved. In this perspective, a deal which others might see as a step towards the ultimate objective will be seen as contemptible retreat from the struggle. 

""""In detaching himself from the Provisionals in 1986 because they'd accepted the legitimacy of the Leinster House parliament, Ó Brádaigh stood by the Republic established on Easter Monday. Looked at from this angle - as legitimate an angle as any other - there is no question: Mr Ó Brádaigh and his followers stand alone in true succession to Easter Week. 

""""Those of us who stand rights outside the Republican tradition and who take a socialist view also see Easter Week in the perspective of our own politics, see its enduring legacy in the fact that it was a blow against the most powerful Empire on earth at the time, and regard it as self-evident that its spirit is best represented today in the fight against the imperial power of the US ruling class. 

""""In this view, the most egregious betrayal of 1916 lies not in grudgingly taking seats in a partitionist parliament but in cheerfully breaking bread with George W Bush."""" 

The Sunday Journal also carried an article entitled """"We're the true inheritors of 1916""""' - Derry Republican Sinn Féin"""" on page 4. 

""""Plans by the Irish Government to celebrate the 1916 Easter Rising are hypocritical, a Derry Republican Sinn Féin (RSF) activist has suggested. 

Derry based spokesman for the movement, Richard Walsh says that RSF are the only true inheritors of the historic insurrection and the proclamation of independence. He hit out at the 26-County Administration for """"war-crimes"""" against those who believed in the ideals of the uprising during the Civil War. 

He said: """"There has been much talk of late about the legacy of the Easter Rising of 1916. 

""""Bertie Ahern has announced plans by the 26-County State to commemorate 1916 with a Free State military parade. 

""""Let no-one forget that it was the Free State Army that executed four Republican soldiers in Co. Donegal by firing squad in 1923 as a reprisal for Republican military operations. True Republicans commemorate the Drumboe Martyrs at Eastertide every year. 

""""The Staters were also responsible for many other war-crimes such as the Ballyseedy massacre in Co. Kerry (also in March, 1923), where eight Republican soldiers were killed whilst strapped to a landmine by Free State forces - miraculously leaving one survivor."""" 

He added that the 26-County government cannot claim ownership to the legacy of the Easter Rising. 

""""Those who not only betrayed the All-Ireland Republic - proclaimed in arms at Easter 1916, endorsed by the people of Ireland in 1918, and effectively established by Dáil Éireann in January, 1919 - but also actively waged war against it cannot claim the legacy of 1916. 

""""These people continue to imprison Republicans by using the Special non-jury Court in Dublin - the same building in which Robert Emmet was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered by the English - on the basis of the opinion of the 26-County police [Gardaí]."""" 

He added that the Republican Movement, on the other hand, had """"remained loyal to the Republic of Clarke; Mac Diarmada; Mac Donagh; Pearse; Ceannt; Connolly and Plunkett, and have commemorated the 1916 Rising every year since. 

""""Those who have maintained this continuity are the true inheritors of the noble ideals of 1916.""""  """,0,0

dpkg Authorship

 Summary 

The discussion is about the authorship of dpkg. dpkg as it stands is a C program with well over 100 contributors.

The anonymous user at 86.176.68.157 claims that the transition from its Perl predecessor to a C program (which was done by the subject of this article) was merely """"porting"""" from one language to another, analogous to translating a novel. I’m not aware of any reference having been provided for this view.

The other view is that the C version was a substantially new program with a much greater feature set. This view is supported by dpkg's own AUTHORS file, which lists the subject of this article as its original author, and describes it as """"based on"""" the Perl version - not merely translated or ported from it.

I see you had deleted the page for Jack Harris (broadcaster) for notability being in question and non-encyclopedia standards, as this is a local sports and news broadcast personality. In this day and age Wikipedia has grown to have more content than any print encyclopedia ever could, including content relevant to certain specific audiences (such as local history). You'll notice most major local journalists and media personalities now have entries. Refer to [staff of WPVI in Philadelphia] where every personality has a page. In the case of the Tampa Bay market, figures such as Keith Cate, Dick Crippen and Paul Dellegatto all have pages, though only of significance to one or two media markets. In fact, on the WTVT page, Jack Harris is now the only Notable former on-air staff not to have a Wikipedia entry. 

The previous Jack Harris page was rather long and included a good deal of information that wasn't necessary in its level of detail and failed to provide enough references to back its notability. With restoring this page, I (or another contributor) could create a considerably trimmed down version (a paragraph or two), explaining his significance as a 50+ year sports, radio and television broadcaster, with ample references and citations.

My advice to Sensei48 is to form a skirmish line, and hold that position. Do not retreat to the timber. Neither should he order a “charge to the rear”: that way disaster lies. 

I include the rousing “Notre Dame Victory March” to help inspire you to defend your remarks of  May 5, 2011:

Rally sons of Notre Dame
Sing her glory, and sound her fame
Raise her Gold and Blue,
And cheer with voices true,
Rah! Rah! For Notre Dame. 
We will fight in every game
Strong of heart and true to her name.
We will ne'er forget her
And we'll cheer her ever,
Loyal to Notre Dame.
Chorus:
Cheer, cheer for Old Notre Dame
Wake up the echoes cheering her name,
Send the volley cheer on high,
Shake down the thunder from the sky,
What though the odds be great or small
Old Notre Dame will win over all,
While her loyal sons are marching
Onward to Victory.

This page is redirected from russian peasant multiplication, but a google search for the exact phrase russian:peasant:multiplication scores 570 and peasant:multiplication only 689. To me this implies that it is nearly 5 times as likely to be refered to as russian peasant multiplication in english. Moving the page is not really worth while, but a recognition of the alternative name in the text seems to make sense to me.

On the subject of the proposed merge with ancient egyptian multiplication, the two techniques, while relying on the same fundemental mathematical principal, are very different in practice. These multiplication schemes are specifically about practice, not theory. The people that use/used these techniques use them empirically.

He now admits he invented the story about Solana being considered the friendliest child in his grade school class.  I was quite surprised to learn this as I honestly thought maybe SqueakBox had information which could be useful to me in the book I am writing about Javier Solana as well as my Wikipedia contributions and blogspot articles.  I asked him for his source and he publicly posted that he got it from the same place as I got that Ariel Sharon refused to meet with Solana.  The problem with this is that Ariel Sharon really did refuse to meet with Javier Solana and SqueakBox deleted that reference from Wikipedia and defamed me all over the web by falsely claiming I had fabricated that information.  What was fabricated was Squeakbox's claim that the evidence (and website links were posted at the time) did not exist.  J'accuse SqueakBox of intellectual dishonesty to the detriment of Wikipedia and I will be seeking to have him permanently banned from Wikipedia.

While I certainly don't condone the incivilty, Damiens, the impression I'm getting is that you can be a pretty frustrating guy. I also get the impression that you don't see that as a bad thing, but frustrating people into submission or Godwin's law isn't the way to win an individual argument or your NFC crusade. You're nominating images for deletion left, right and centre based on technicalities in the NFCC policy and NFC guideline without regard for their encyclopaedic benefit or the spirit of those rules and you're weathering editors down to the extent that you're driving them away from uploading images or even from contributing by tagging their images at a near-robotic speed and frequency. That's not what the rules are for, that's not what Twinkle is for (as your previous trips to ANI should have made you aware) and if that's what was in the best interests of the project, we'd have a bot doing it. You've been offered a perfectly dignified solution that would allow you to continue the good that you do while mitigating the negative effects in the form of a voluntary undertaking not to nominate more than two images per uploader per day. My advice to you would be to take the offer and save us all some time—the laternative is that somebody will take this to ANI or ArbCom and we all waste a lot of time with the result that you're formally restricted from doing what you could restrict yourself from voluntarily.  | Penny for your thoughts?

I began writing the following statement (excepting its two postscripts) before I was blocked. I suspect that User: AuburnPilot had me blocked, in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct. Although I was directed to request an unblock of User: Physicq210, who had blocked me, requesting such of the latter would require that I censor myself, and write as though User: Physicq210 had acted in good faith, and was one of the good guys. That would be surreal, and would give User: Physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT User: Physicq210, but since I’m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want User: Physicq210 to read it. For if I can be banned from Wikipedia for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English. After all, if I wanted to be a lackey, I could go to graduate school.

WIKI Administrators’ Notice Board Incidents
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents

User: AuburnPilot

A few days ago, User: AuburnPilot began stalking me, checking wherever I had made edits, and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them. He or she has been manipulating Wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship. User: AuburnPilot cannot even stand for Wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. Zero tolerance!

He claims of any source he politically dislikes, that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “POV,” another favorite dodge for those at Wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own POV), even though the one source is a previously published, classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web (http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html), which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site, and the other source is the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the Duke rape hoax (http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm).

Note that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles, since I hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: Crystal Gail Mangum, Michael Nifong, 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal and Racial profiling.
I’ve been involved in edit wars before, though I have never been the aggressor, and have never initiated an elective edit war, though given the self-assurance that aggressors such as User: AuburnPilot exude, perhaps I ought to reconsider that position. It seems that aggressors rule here.

The reason I am making a formal complaint is that User: AuburnPilot has tonight upped the ante, threatening to have me banned
(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&redirect;=no), if I do not surrender to his censorship. Should you find for me, please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease-and-desist order. Should you, however, find for the censor, please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors.

P.S. January 19, 2007 115A EST. Since beginning this complaint, I see that User: AuburnPilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony, User: Physicq210, to block me, thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me, but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (And no, I am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. If I were into such deception, I would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) And I was unable to e-mail User: Physicq210 because I am not logged in and “You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210)

If this isn’t cyber-Stalinism, I don’t know what is! So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (User: AuburnPilot’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.

P.P.S The message here says that I was “temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” What the heck is that supposed to mean? For restoring footnotes and links that User: AuburnPilot had vandalized? If that constitutes “disruptive edits,” then you’ve utterly given up on honest English and all human decency.

The well-established status quo of the article is that it states the Bealtles were active exclusively from 1960 to 1970.

180d069a8d003ccc,"Comment - 'Station' as a word essentially means 'a fixed point'.  I'm not sure of the exact definition in the past, but it pre-dates railways by several centuries.  'Battle stations' as a term dates back some considerable way, and naval vessels in their correct patrol areas were said to be 'on station' in Nelson's time.  I believe it is derived from a Latin word meaning 'still' (i.e. 'stationary').  'Railway station' as a term goes back at least as far as 1825, while 'train station' was not recorded for over a century after that, nor were 'petrol station', 'power station' or 'bus station'.  One important consideration is how widespread a term is.  Is it a 'railway station' in Australia, India, South Africa or any other country where the British built the railways?  Finally, the term 'train' may be incorrect when referring to modern passenger railway vehicles.  Under some definitions, trains are exclusively loco-hauled or push-pull.  Most modern passenger vehicles are multiple units, and thus not 'trains' under these definitions, because there is no locomotive.128.240.229.3",0,0

That explains how certain features don't appear to be geographically-correct. Further to 117Avenue's comments here, I have the following:
portions of St. Albert's boundaries are incorrect, particularly:
southwest boundary should follow the shoreline of Big Lake; and
northeast boundary is incorrect (refer to this CRB map);
the Sherwood Park Urban Service Area boundary south of Wye Road appears to be a tad exaggerated in terms of size (please double-check, referring to the above linked CRB map);
although the Sherwood Park Freeway is """"technically"""" numbered Highway 100, it is not signed as such, so I recommend removal (note this other CRB map, which was prepared by Alberta Transportation, labels it as """"S.P.F."""" with no background shield or oval);
numerous arterial roads in Edmonton are missing further to those recently identified by 117Avenue (I recommend using the Edmonton TMP's Figures 3.9, 4.1, and 7.1 as a starting point for what roads within Edmonton should be included);
numerous equivalent arterial roads in St. Albert (i.e., Levasseur Rd, Meadowview Ave/McKenney Ave/Bellerose Dr, Grandin Rd, Sturgeon Rd, Dawson Rd, Hogan Rd) and Sherwood Park (i.e., Sherwood Dr between Broadmoor and Brentwood, Granada Blvd, Petroleum Way/Lakeland Dr, Clover Bar Rd north of Hwy 16, Twp Rd 534 along the northernmost boundary) are missing;
the applicable St. Albert roads that actually extend to its municipal boundary should be extended as well;
I'd also like to see RR 231, 232, and 233 (extensions of Sherwood Park's Clover Bar Rd, Brentwood Blvd, and Broadmoor Blvd) shown between Sherwood Park and Hwy 628; and

I looked at the block history, but it didn't make any sense to me, and it certainly wasn't anything i did or would ever do.  Not my style.

The interior of the fictional Masyaf citadel in Assassin's Creed contains an extensive library, and the rear is a lush garden above a sheer drop. These two properties happen to be known features of the real Alamut, which was also a Hashashin fortress at this time. Subsequently, it is likely that the fictional Masyaf is a combination of features of both fortresses.

It may also be the case that the in-game character Al-Mualim (""""teacher"""") is a portrayal of the real Rashid ad-Din Sinan, who was operating out of Masyaf at the time the game is set. Both characters are the leaders of the Masyaf citadel. In addition, both ad-Din Sinan and the fictional Al-Mualim die around the same point in time (e.g. 1192-4 compared to 1191). So there certainly are elements of the real Masyaf which have carried into the game, albeit modified.

It's not that uncommon for vowels to be raised before nasals.  Take for example the pin-pen merger in Southern American English and in southwestern Ireland or the non-phonemic æ-tensing that takes place in accents that have undergone the Northern cities vowel shift.  The only reason I brought this up is because I imagine it is very noticeable to English ears (it's even noticeable to my American ears).  Many English people might pronounce man as , which sounds quite a bit different from .  You're the Aussie here, so I'm sure you can verify this by simply contrasting your man with your bad (in this case both would have a long vowel, so try to listen for the quality of the vowels) or your noun with your loud.  This is just another little thing that distinguishes Aussie English from English English; that's all.",0,1

 These files on pages 49 thru to 54 establish that Earhart landed in the Marshall Islands and was taken prisoner by the Japanese. After reading the files it is obvious that Earhart and Noonan were both alive and had landed safely, however into or near a secret Japanese base. Due to the planes altitude the radio transmissions misled those waiting to intercept Earhart as planned.

Union of states
I am surprised that it got reverted again to federal republic . The issue in question here is whether India is a union or a federation. The Indian Constitution defines India as a Union of states and as such an Encylopedia article like this should reflect that. I am more surprised by the foolishness of some editors here who think Wikipedia should not reflect realities but be based on some incorrect WP precendents. Maybe this is due to the fact the place where he comes from has no written constitution. But it is wrong to label India as a Federal Republic, when it is clearly not so. CIA website is not a WP:RS in this issue.-  """,0,0

(Let's leave innocent bystanders alone, discussion moved here)

Your campaign for censorship got a strong head start. I dont blame you, as it's the guy below who is adding fuel to the fire. Friends? )  
With this unappologetic response, I think a longer ban is in order.  
Here's the one vying for head of the censorship department lately. Mind your own business a little more, Irpin.  
My dear friend. As it has been ruled by the courts, Freedom of Speech does not extend to protection of ethnic slurs and hate speech whose propagation brought about your ban. Besides, nothing could stop you from using one of your socks. So, you were not really censored. Last but not least, you could take your grievances to your talk page which was not protected. I think Renata was too lenient. But be sure that unless you change your behavior, the next block will be permanent.  

Insinuations and wishful thinking. The almighty King Solomon of Wikipedia, almost. I think people have been too lenient in scrutinizing your smear campaign. This is not Renata's fault, but a consequence of the lack of disciplinary action in your case (long overdue), an institution you so vehemently attack, counting on the ignorant unsuspicion of a few to abuse against other users. Soon, you wont be fooling anyone any longer, Irpin, so watch it (take my good-spirited advice).",0,0

I see that you have pointed out that you are an admin.  This is good.  However, your handling of my edit to Woody Allen was heavy handed and quite clumsy.  I will point out that good admins attempt to call on a different admin to assist them when they are in a conflict with a non admin, such as myself.  I now understand your point about the first sentence.  I just went out and found a reliable source for Ronan's comment in the second sentence.  Ronan's comment is notable (in hundred's of waysespecially since he is the only biological child of both Allen and Farrow).  I understand that I should not have put back in the first sentence, but on the other hand your edit was wrong.  Yes, I know you are an admin and as a good admin you want my constructive feedback to make Wikipedia work better (and I'm sure that Jimbo would agree that my feedback to you will make Wikipedia better).  You should have only removed the first sentence (because it was not supported by a RS) which is how it ultimately turned out.  However, for whatever reason you decided to remove the whole section that another edit placed in the article, including the direct comment of Ronan Farrow, Allen's only biological child.  That was heavy-handed editing.  The quote is notable.  Yes, it was initially placed in the article, by another editor, with the support of a non-RS; however, it is all over the Internet.  It is quoted by literally hundreds of RS's and you should have left in the quote in the second sentence and found a RS to replace the non-reliable source.  That would have been the correct way to handle the situation.  I hope my constructive feedback will be helpful to you in the future.  I fully expect to hear from you I'm just not sure if it is going to be positive or negative, but I do expect to hear from you.

I think that many of the new tags can be deleted, personally. I also have noticed that the page is written in a way that is just criticisms, without at least a brief acknowledgment of the opposing view for NPOV, and without acknowledging that many criticisms apply to only some adherents of religion (for example, not all believers condone blood sacrifice, to name an obvious example that recently attracted attention).

Comment on point of disagreement. While worldwide coverage (e.g., WP:BIAS) is not a GA requirement per se, broad coverage is, and that means the article """"addresses the main aspects of the topic"""". Exactly what this implies involves some subjective interpretation and judgment, which is one reason that GA reviews are conducted by human beings rather than bots. In some cases, it may be reasonable to argue that an article about a topic of global interest (in this case in most common law countries) does not address the main aspects if it only concentrates on the North American case.

I am not fabricating original research as it is all already in the article. It would be appropriate if you were to provide sources contradicting their occupation of such areas within those dates if the article is wrong. As for the lines drawn, as far as I've seen in books they are only used to show the movement of armies in detailed books of military campaigns and are never shown on a map depicting the extent of a kingdom.

This theory states that the Universe was originally all matter. The theory is based on the fact that a vacuum can only be created when work is done. The exact proportion and density of the original matter is not known. It is only an educated guess that the matter was a gas. The Gas Theory states: 1 Space is infinite = n/1 2 Matter is infinite = n/1 3 Time is infinite 4 Energy is the reactant

n/1 matter + energy = (n/1 space + (1/n matter - energy))

The starting point is theoretical: Matter n/1 + n/1 energy = space n/1/ matter 1/n - n/1 energy “ n/1 over 1/n “ equals an """"open proportion"""" an unknown balance. Since the universe is not subject to proportion, all things are technically part of a type of gas.

The Gas Theory

The GAS THEORY states that a GAS in some low density form or equal to or proportional to: 1/infinite times a Helium atom (or any particle). (matter/space-energy) is/was the """"original substance"""". A property-less gas. This gas had POTENTIAL energy. Ironically only because it was substance and had mass.... This GAS was... At a single volume, pressure, and temperature. First the GAS condensed some. Then the GAS developed some properties... 1st, the variation of volume... CREATED the WEAK FORCE from Vacuum/MATTER 2nd, the variation of pressure... CREATED GRAVITATION from condensation/MATTER 3rd, the variation of temperature... CREATED ELECTROMAGNETISM from hot and cold +(P,T,V)/MATTER 4th, friction developed (KINETIC ENERGY)... This CAUSED electrical activity, condensations and... """"Dynamic cosmic relationships"""" A gaseous-energetic cloud of """"Microwave laden matter/energy reactions."""" All these (1-4) CAUSED and CREATED The STRONG FORCE (HIGHLY KINETIC AND CONDENSED MATTER) Which lead to... Spontaneous disintegration's and atomic radiation. All this lead to the universe as we know it..

Matter which we know exists and is the basis for all things remains The foundation of all things.... With the BIG BANG nothing must become something With GAS THEORY Matter CREATES SPACE from a void in MATTER The events that are described are """"Reasonable and logical""""

Because there is something. (Matter) If there were nothing even nothing is something.. However, if there were nothing then life could not exist. The Math... (n = """"infinite quantity"""" any number not 0 not negative 1/n x of a helium atom = a gas (matter)) The universe, calculated at the starting point = n/1 matter and 1/n space + (n/1)energy +time """"so n/1 matter/ 1/n space + n/1 energy will equal 1/n matter/ n/1 space - n/1 energy +time"""" Space """"was"""" created by this. A VOID was opened. this is the gas theory math SPOKEN .... """"""""infinite matter and little space equals infinite space and little matter with energy being the reactant"""" OR matter/space plus energy plus time equals space/matter minus energy minus time""""

0c40383c74b56452,"""Well, I am not trying to pick a fight ) but I have NPOV issues with this article.  It reads  at the moment  like a celebration of scientific progress.  I have two problems: first, it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in, to science as a specifically Western project.  Second, although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge, the history of science is rather more complicated than that.

One way to deal with this (if others find my criticisms valid) is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge (from Aristotle to Bacon to Comte to Popper; from Aristotle to Darwin to Mendel to Mayr; from Aristotle to Newton to Einstein and Planck; etc, on the one hand, and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science (i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science), on the other.  For example, I think everyone agrees that Aristotle, Newton, Einstein and Planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world  but I think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims.  I'd hope a good article on """"the history of science"""" would inform me of these issues, and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another.

I am no expert on this but I really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of, say, Thomas Kuhn and Bruno Latour, could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously, as well as the claims of those with opposing views.

I am glad Ed has begun this article, it can be really important and it is a needed contribution.   SR

PeeJay I have to disagree with some of your statements, “Seems pretty categorical that the name the club gives itself in English should be the one we use here”.  If Pele calls himself Pele all over the world in Spanish, German, Italian etc but wants to give himself the name “Frogman” in English – it doesn’t mean that everyone has to agree with him or call him this.  Especially if every English speaking person knows of Pele as Pele.  To be listed as anything else in a reference encyclopedia like this one is just problematic.  So in this case it should be listed as what it is known as  and used widespreadly which is Inter Milan.
Also you mention “you can clearly see you've reached the right page from the opening sentence” but lots of people will be confused – which shouldn’t happen.  The page is also difficult to find and an example of this is from a Google search for the words “Inter Milan” – you would expect for a Wikipedia article to appear on the search results but the Wikipedia article  does not appear ANYWHERE on Google because of the current naming convention. []
You say people will “learn something in the process”, but this is irrelevant as the primary things to do, the BASIC thing that has to be done on an encyclopedia is to “reference information” that “can be quickly found when needed” and not appearing in Google search results because of a badly named article is not helping people quickly access information.
Kauffner suggests that if the club calls itself Inter then that is another reason to include it in the (full) title ie Inter Milan (NOT to name the article Inter)
Also the club DOES refer to itself as Inter Milan and here is the evidence to back this up:  the Google search result text for “InterMilan” displays the official English title of their website given from Inter Milan’s HTML = (Top Google result + 3rd Sentence down) [].  The HTML can also be viewed by going to the website homepage, right clicking the page, then view page source, CTRL F to search for “Inter Milan” and it is the 2nd result = """"Inter Milan official website""""  []      '''' [ talk ]  """,0,0

                                                       HOW OBAMA AND ACORN STOLE THE ELECTION OF 2008

Overview:
Presently, ACORN is under FBI investigation for massive voter fraud and other serious  crimes in connection to the 2008 presidential election directly concerning Barack Obama  who was one of its principles. It's a matter we take very seriously,"""" FBI spokeswoman  Bridget Patton told the Associated Press. """"It is against the law to register someone to  vote who does not fall within the parameters to vote, or to put someone on there  falsely."""" 

Acorn is the largest of a plethora of radical left wing groups with more than 1,200  neighborhood chapters in 110 cities across the country with a national budget of $37  million who's sole purpose was to suddenly prior to the election spring into action  after quietly building up over the years to gerrymander the 2008 presidential election  through massive voter fraud. However, they claim to be nonpartisan but are radically  left wing with actual communist memberships. Most of their funding comes from U.S.  government grants. Further, to that end their intentions were to bring in and harbor  hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens from various countries and placing them in HUD  public housing and """"choice"""" voucher programs awarding free houses to illegal aliens at  taxpayer expense while wantonly neglecting the disabled who desperately needed housing  thereto. This was coerced into action through legal threats to these agencies citing  civil rights laws. 

Through these intimidations, using civil rights laws it further precipitated first the  collapse of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when these impossible  mortgages collapsed in the fall of 2008 along with the other forced """"minority"""" bad loans  at HUD which led to the collapse of the mortgage industry starting a domino effect that  led to the failing of all top five investment banks on wall street and the mess we are  in today in February 2009. The government initiated """"bailouts"""" (really government  theft) and gifted itself nearly ten trillion dollars in """"stimulus packages"""" as an  excuse to fix this smaller two hundred billion dollar bad mortgage problem. Most of  this on debt to China who has precipitated this by pegging the dollar and implementing  grossly unfair trade practices initiating monstrous trade deficits and debt we will  never rise above. Although President George Bush(R) played his share in ridiculous  deregulation, ACORN with backing from Barney Frank(D) the chairman of the House  Financial Services Committee which oversees housing and banking industries really  initiated the whole debacle by forcing these ridiculous minority loans.  

The case details: 
95% of polled U.S. citizens object to illegal immigration and open boarders.  Nonetheles, Maricopa County Arizona is a microcosm, analogues to how the influx of  illegal and legal immigration is causing huge population increases raising serious  questions about their rising undue influence upon our elections, particularly the  election of Barack Obama of late and the fairness, legality and constitutionality  thereof as assessed by CNN and announced by prime-time television CNN anchor Lou Dobbs  upon his analysis of the latest census figures ramifications. Such is the case because  in Maricopa County, much like other counties in the United States population not  citizenship determines voting districts. And there's clear, mounting evidence that  both illegal and legal aliens are replacing long time residence and partisans using  people that can't vote as """"filler people"""" to fill up the extra people needed to make up  a given district along with the people that favor their political party. Such is  particularly the case because the census figures don't distinguish the difference  between legal and illegal aliens and most of the illegals are coming across the border  from Mexico who is actively investing in and interfering in our electoral process.  v=8oTQoZifckU&feature;=related 

Polls in Mexico indicate that the majority favored Obama and the election results  showed clearly that such """"minority"""" voters such as """"Hispanic"""" and """"African American""""  voters overwhelmingly voted for him and clearly won the election for Obama.

1.QUOTE FROM ARTICLE - Gobind Singh Mansukhani states how vegetarianism and meat-eating has been left to the individual Sikh. 2.QUOTE FROM DELETED PASSAGE -scholars hold a view that Sikhism has an ambivalent view on diet, yet some accept that there are, 

“passages against meat eating”. REF for both 1 and 2. Gobind Singh Mansukhani, Introduction to Sikhism, Delhi: Hemkunt Press, ISBN 81-7010-181-6, “There are passages against meat, in the Adi Granth”. Both references from the SAME scholar, yet one is accepted which is favor of an ambivalent view towards diet, while another assessment from the same scholar admitting their are passages against meat eating, is not accepted. Why the Double standards? 

Why does the ADMIN on sikhhistory, blatantly support their own ideological stance, to the point of synthesis, and selectively using texts and passages, from authors who they cite, and then reject the same authors when going against their position? 

How can you adressing harassment, yet make no attempt on addressing the issue of BIAS in your articles? Do you only protect the Orthodox Sunni islamic view? and the unorthodox shia view?...IF that is not the case, then please can you tell me why sikhhistory ADMIN have taken the biased stance of only abiding by an orthodox POV.

I dont think these questions im asking is harassment, but if my objection is avoided time and again, and the same allegations being made towards the same ADMIN for being one sided, you again have AVOIDED the issue at hand, which is a biased article protected by ADMIN to support their own beleifs, i think that is a greater offense than my trying to get some sense from the ADMIN in question. lol.",0,0

8841f41306f43817,"- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.

Deletionism and inclusionism in Wikipedia

 Third Party Review, WikiProject New York Posting 
Transferred from User Page:
Hi Cmagha! I never saw the original AfD discussion, but I think the article looks like the start of something fantastic! My only concern would be that the majority of your references seem to come from """"Cornell specific"""" sources (i.e. Cornell Daily Sun, Cornell Era, Cornell Register, etc...). College/ university published sources are a bit of a grey area within WP:N when dealing with a campus organization, as some may not consider these to be """"independent of the subject."""" That being said, we aren't dealing with a fly by night college band that played at Moonshadows and had a writeup in the Ithacan, this is a literary society almost as old as Cornell University itself and has had significance well beyond East Hill. Despite the large number of CU oriented sources (which I personally believe are independent), you have enough that would be unambiguously independent to survive another AfD if need be. I'd post what you have now and keep looking for more! ' says you, says two  
 Wow, great work.  Sorry I've been out of the loop.  Double smiley face from the Syracuse Orangemen brought in to ensure neutrality.  Think the critics need to read the article from a distance  this is hardly promotional, when you think about it.  It is basically saying that Cornell University had a chance to excell in an intellectual activity, and tanked.  We obviously would not have done that at SU.  I do think there is a Sumner cite out there to, that Cmagha missed.  Will look for it.

The Irving article has been noticed on the WikiProject New York page; some helpful comments sent back.  Did not receive notice on your G4 decision; we will be asking to move the article back to mainspace shortly.  Thanks for the aid.   
 No. Unless you have addressed the significant issues concerning allegations of misrepresenting sources and the contention that all of the sources are tangential or trivial then this isn't going back into mainspace.  Humbug!

 Proposed move 

Rename article as Manchester United 0–1 Arsenal (20 October 1990) and keep flags in teamsheets. The article is about the match and the current title sensationalises one incident, though that incident has made the match notable.

I originally raised this proposal on WP:FOOTY but according to WP:BRD I should raise it here as I am seeking consensus, although I do apparently have the right per WP:BOLD to go ahead and complete the move immediately. The objections to flags seem to centre on a view that the article is, as the title would suggest, about a brawl. But, as I've pointed out above, the article is about the match and I think it should be retitled to comply with other similar match reports in the First Division Matches category. I'll abide by BRD here and leave this a week. If no objections then, I'll go ahead and move the article. Thanks.

 Some thoughts:
Yes, if you define """"environmental journal"""" as any journal that ever published an article dealing with environmental issues. Determining this will often involve original research and interpretation.
No, if you go by the inclusion criteria given in the lead of this list: this journal clearly is not """"focused"""" on environmental issues, even though they may be included in the scope.
No, if you go by the journal's homepage, which not even mentions the word """"environmental"""".
So it all depends on how you want to define """"environmental journal"""".

 """"SCIENTIFIC"""" SKEPTIC ???! 

He never went to college, so why this article calls him a scientific skeptic ? May be some people of his skeptic team are real scientifics, they sure got graded from some college, but this """"debunker"""" never went to any college ! so how can wikipedia call him a """"scientific""""? Do you know at least if he uses a scientific method for whatever he tries to debunk ?
People, he didn't finished high school !!!

http://www.sptimes.com/Floridian/41498/The__quack__hunter.html  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 82.224.230.5   

You can't even write proper English. What college did you go to?  What's up, Doc? 
Thanks for the link, though. That's a great article on the amazing one.   

 I think scientific skepticism is related to following the scientific method, not formal education h2g2bob (talk) 
For sure. The user 82.224.230.5 would likely know that. It's just trolling behavior.  What's up, Doc? 

I'm not english and I rather be trolling right now than being a 12/13 years old wikipedia non-life geek (you know what I'm talkng about)!
Oh, we know what you're talking about, all right. Trust me.   
His IP is French, so, yeah, I won't hold his English skills against him. His personality, and his intellectual abilities, however, are things that I will hold against him. 
Back on topic, though, it is a common mistake that people make. People fail to understand that finding out the cause of flummery is a field in and of itself. Knowing when you need to enlist the help of an expert, and knowing what the expert is actually able to do, instead of assuming that 'expert ~= god' - that is a skill that many people lack. I suspect that Randi knows more about most scientific fields than many experts know about scientific fields outside their expertise.   

So according to you, it's enough to only """"suspect"""" his scientifc knowledge to make disappear any kind of information related to his educational background ?!  I mean, is this the way wikipedia works ? you """"suspect"""", how sure is that?! why didn't you even """"wonder"""", that would have been a better reason for making disappear my contribution about his educational career don't you think ?!
I can't believe guys like you run wikipedia like kings of the info.. simply pitious.—Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 
I guess we should leave the 'no high-school' line in there.  It has nothing to do with 'scietific' vs 'non-scientific'.   His methods are unquestionably scientific, which of course explains why so few high profile psychics and fakers apply for the million dollar challenge.    
I added it back in with a bit of useful context, and minus the inferred line about never having been to college, which is not supported by the given source.   

 Works for me.  I'm guessing if he can teach college without a high-school degree, he could have attended college as well.  -)    

The IP again demonstrates that he's either a troll or an idiot, or both.  What's up, Doc? """,1,0

One act is going to be added for the injury to the russian bar trio. That is listed as the wild card act and the people up for it are at the bottom of the eliminated list. There's a never before seen act with three children (yodeling?) and one of them playing the double bass. Maybe I missed something. Other than that, only 1 act is missing and all of the televised dismissials are accounted for (except for the older gentleman keyboardist.)   """,0,0

I'll concede the """"shoutaboutastic"""" (though only because the English Wikipedia is read by many for whom English is not a first language) but if you pay closer attention to the half a dozen or so examples of true """"myths"""" I have provided above, you'll see that they are indeed factually correct - that is, that what is alleged to be a myth is in fact a fact. Now, we could waste time discussing whether the word """"myth"""" always implies falsehood but let's not bother. Let's take the """"myth"""" in """"Euromyth"""" to mean exactly what the coiners of """"Euromyth"""" intended it to mean: a falsehood about the European Union. It would also save a lot of time if you and other Wikipedians just accepted that there are dozens of other examples of non-mythical Euromyths out there. Is that acceptance likely? No. The Commission has spent billions on propaganda in the last two decades. (Will I keep chipping away at the Commission's outrageous Euromythmyths? Not while sober, no. Who would?)

You are being a hypocrite yourself in the regard that you yourself violated Improper Consensus Building when you ignored the discussion dating back from December 2009. You are simply abusing user power then accusing me of doing so. You also ignored my requests to wait until an Admin settles this, and then lied saying that """"I want to work together with you"""" when it appears you have no intention. The record is all there. Why you continue to lie in the face of the record being present is appalling. You yourself need to read this: How experienced editors avoid being dragged into edit wars. The Administrator will see in the record that you continue to ignore, that you made zero attempt to engage in discussion. You need to read this carefully yourself:
[is consensus?]
How not to achieve consensus
Don't edit war.
Don't simply state your position over and over, without explaining your underlying concerns and interests.
Don't canvass other editors who agree with you.
Don't give up when people disagree on a specific proposal.
Don't take a hard line position to extract concessions from other editors. This often backfires, and undermines the reasonableness of your viewpoint.
Don't question the other party's motive.

 Thoughts on Editing war 

In all honest Caleb, I feel your argument is valid. As an outsider that just started reading Seth Speaks mid last year. I did my own research on this topic to seeing a big difference in how it currently being presented. Have you tried contacting the people directly associated with the book? I feel that Wikipedia administratration is being unfair to Celeb. With lack of sensiblity and respect of his efforts to express the works of actual writers and editors in a domain he isn't familiar with. I made an account just so I express my words of gratitude for your efforts Caleb of preserving the message of this topic in an unbiased way! Don't give up, for the people directly invovle with this topic will side with you...Took me a while to figure this out ) 
  

 FYI, Caleb is topic banned from this article. As to """"side with you"""", be very careful about siding with Caleb. He has violated a number of policies during his efforts to protect this subject and even got blocked. He was unblocked only after promising not to edit this article. You should also read about meatpuppetry: """"A new user who engages in the same behavior as another user in the same context, and who appears to be editing Wikipedia solely for that purpose, may be subject to the remedies applied to the user whose behavior they are joining."""" If your behavior becomes too similar to his, the duck test may apply. It hasn't yet, and I'm hoping to save you trouble.

 I am providing this advice to save to from running into the same problems which have hounded his editing. I'll leave a welcome template on your talk page. It contains links to our policies and guidelines. Please read them. Good luck here. BTW, this also applies to the Jane Roberts article.     

 Always good to welcome a new user with threats . . . 70.186.173.82

9efe4e2a595d30c1,"TVTimes images
Hi Ben! You've recently uploaded and added to articles some images of covers of TVTimes magazine. You've correctly tagged them as fair-use/magazine, but I don't think the images are being used under fair-use considerations.

The tag for fair-use/magazines says:

...It is believed that the use of low-resolution images of magazine covers: to illustrate the publication of the issue of the magazine in question,...

The images are being used to illustrate programmes, not the TVTimes magazine. Therefore I'd say they're not being fairly used under the terms of Wikipedia's fair-use copyrights policy.

Additionally, the tag says ...To the uploader: please add a detailed fair use rationale for each use, as described on Wikipedia:Image description page, as well as the source of the work and copyright information. These images do not have a fair use rationale on the image page and they don't provide the source of the work (scan, taken from another website etc).

I suspect that the images will need to be removed from the articles you've put them in, but I'd be interested in hearing your views. Thanks ➨ ❝REDVERS❞

The picture is an example of the POV it represents; as such, it is perfectly appropriate.  Please stop deleting it.  As for the allegations of Roed-Larsen, why do imagine that they were based on the IDF spokesman's claim, as opposed to the many claims of massacre from Palestinians weeks earlier.  On April 4, Secretary-General of the Palestinian Authority, Ahmed Abdel Rahman, complained in an interview on Palestinian television about “…world silence over the massacres being perpetrated against the Palestinian people.” (BBC Worldwide Monitoring). On April 6, Nabil Sha'ath delivered a speech at a meeting of the Arab League, in which he charged that “a 'massacre' was underway in the Palestinian refugee camp of Jenin.” (Deutsche Presse-Agentur) He also “compared Israeli actions in the West Bank towns of Jenin and Nablus to the 1982 massacres of hundreds of Palestinans…” (The Associated Press). On April 7, Abdel Rahman told NBC’s Tim Russert, “The victims so far has been over 250 Palestinians killed, many of them are children and women.” Saeb Erekat is quoted by Washington Post as having said “This is not fighting between armies, but a massacre in Jenin camp.""""  Why do you think that the IDF spokesman's statements from over a week later were so influential, as opposed to these many public statements by Palestinian spokesmen which were widely disseminated in major news outlets?

 Bosniakophobia article 

Hi BigHaz, yes, I said it once, but I wanted to give more detailed explanation second time, so I think my opinion should also be taken into consideration both at Bosniakophobia Srbophobia talk page. Thank you. 

Protest

Why did you take my vote?
Why did you cross """"delete"""" two times?
This way you censored my vote not once, but twice !
I will complain to other admin's for your clearly illegal behaviour!  

Context Note: The discussion here refers to the user's comments at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bosniakophobia. He had posted a bolded """"Do not delete"""" on three separate occasions, and I struck two of them out for the sake of clarity when the AfD was going to be closed. He still has one of his three """"votes"""" (inasmuch as they are in fact votes), which is as many as everyone else involved. The """"more detailed explanation"""" to which he refers isn't in fact present, as it is in fact roughly 50% of a longer explanation that he had already posted. Again, in the interests of clarity, I struck this out.  - Schreit mich an 

 Okay 

Concerning your comments on my TalkPage, now that you gave enought explanation, fair enough.
Although I wish you somehow merged all comments together instead of crossing them, but anyways. I see that Serbs are winning against nomination of Bosniakophobia as an article @ Wikipedia. What Serbs did BigHaz, and you need to understand this from factual and fair view of perspective, they (Serbs) invented word """"Serbophobia"""", then nominated her on Wikipedia, and other Serbs came and voted """"YES! Keep it!"""" and now thousands of """"wikipedia scrapper pages"""" are basicly spreading this word as a cancer over the internet. So, let's delete both Bosniakophobia and Serbophobia, because NONE of these words is in English dictionary ! So why keep Serbophobia? Why? Please tell me your reasoning. Please! Thanks.  
I would have merged the comments if there'd been anything to merge. As it was, one comment was a duplicate of the other, which meant that there was precisely nothing which could gainfully have been merged. In terms of Serbophobia, you'll note that I have not expressed any opinion at all in that AfD (even I have my limits when it comes to the murky world of Balkan ethnic politics). However, I will investigate the matter further, since you've asked.  - Schreit mich an 
Contextual Postscript: Having looked into the murky world of Balkan ethnic politics slightly further in the interests of making sure that I wasn't shooting off my mouth about something that multiple people were doing, I noticed at the Serbophobia AfD that the above user had in fact done much the same thing that he'd done at the Bosniakophobia discussion - although with the opposite intention. I repeated the process of striking the duplicate """"delete"""" votes. One of the delete votes had a relatively long and potentially important rationale attached, so I didn't strike it. Of course, anything that's struck out is still patently visible to a closing admin or contributing user, and more legible via the editing screen if legibility is a problem. One of these days I'm going to have to make good my promise to myself of learning Serbo-Croatian.  - Schreit mich an

 WikiMarkup 

Wikipedia has it's own special """"language"""" called """"WikiMarkup"""". It is very important, therefore, to know a good deal of it when you begin to write an article.

 Links 
 External links 
An external link is a link that goes to another website, besides Wikipedia. They are formatted like this: [Name of website goes here].
For example: [http://www.google.com] becomes . 
To display alternate text for an external link, type [Name of website goes here Alternate text goes here]. Note the space between the website's name and the alternate text.
For example: [http://www.google.com Google search engine] becomes Google search engine.

 Internal links 
An internal link is a link that links to any page within Wikipedia. They are formatted like this:[[Name of page goes here]]
For example: [[Giraffe]] becomes Giraffe.
An internal link can display alternate text through the use of a pipe character """"|""""
For example: [[Giraffe|A long-necked animal that lives on the plains of Africa]]. becomes A long-necked animal that lives on the plains of Africa.
Normal text can also be blended into a link.
For example: I like [[Giraffe]]s. becomes I like Giraffes.
Internal links can link across namespaces.
For example: [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]] becomes Wikipedia:Neutral point of view.
They can also use Pipe tricks.
For example: [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|]] (note the pipe character before the two end brackets) becomes Neutral point of view
For example: [[Orange (fruit)|]] becomes Orange.

 Redirects 

A redirect is a page that, if accessed, sends you to a related page automagically. For an example of this, see Gill net. Note how at the top of the page it says (Redirected from Gill net). Voila!
For example: #REDIRECT [[United States]] redirects whatever page it was on to United States.

Quote from Peter Sugar, """"The Early History and the Establishment of the Ottomans in Europe"""": There the Hungarian-Wallachian alliance was still in effect, and Bayezid I now moved against Mircea. Once again, many Christians, mostly Serbs, fought in his army, including Kraljevic (the son of the king) Marko, the hero of another famous Epic, who died not in that battle, but in the Battle of Arges which Bayezid fought with the Wallachians on May 17, 1395. Mircea appears to have been victorious militarily, but his forces and resources were so depleted that he had to acknowledge the loss of the Dobrudja, into which Bayezid moved Turkish garrisons. He also had to accept the status of an Ottoman vassal and pay regular tribute. This arrangement lasted until the Danubian Principalities regained their independence. Although it created problems for the Romanians, it saved them from the much harsher treatment that went with direct Ottoman rule, especially during the centuries of decline.  """,0,0

Ok, I added a paragraph about Native Americans and the national park. Chief Joseph's band crossing the park is perhaps the key event, but also notable is that the """"Sheepeater"""" Shoshones had been permanent residents of what became the park until leaving per a treaty (unratified), and that after the Nez Perce crossing of the park and a Bannock band entering the park in 1878, and the Sheepeater Indian War, park superintendent Norris had a fort built to make sure Indians would be prevented from entering the park (the Sheepeater War did not occur in the park but influenced Norris's decision). I'm not sure where this fort was built. These three bits of history seem important enough to include in the park's History section. Unfortunately due to the years when these things took place, the 1870s and 1880s, chronologically they fit into the subsection called """"Park creation""""and seem somewhat out of place among all the info about the early superintendents, rangers, and so on.

Islam does intrinsically promote religious fanaticism, does promote violence and ill-feeling towards non-Muslims, does seem to spawn many terrorists, and is intrinsically hostile to concepts such as equality, tolerance, democracy and human rights.

I thought a phobia was an irrational fear of something.

 Discussion of the Insane Guy's Is Not Worthy Enough To Devote the Entire First Paragraph To Him 

As outlined in my comments immediately above, Susan also argued with a man accusing Obama of being a fascist. Xeno attempted to devote the entire first paragraph to the little exchange she had with him - trying especially hard to make him, and hence the others, appear as dumb as possible. For instance, Xeno only included his statement """"because he is,"""" when in actually the (concededly insane and dumb) man said """"because he is . . . all of the politicians need 1 term limits . . . the pirates are in Washington."""" But I will adopt the wikipedia assumptions that everyone always says they comply with but really don't and go ahead and just assume Xeno acted in good faith. It must have just been a small mistake.
To the extent that her exchange with the first guy - and particularly, any """"clipping"""" of his statements - would be relevant, I would argue (and I could find support) that it would be relevant to the extent of showing the disparity of treatment with which Susan has shown liberals depicting Republican presidents as Hitler and conservatives depicting Democrat presidents as liberals.

Probably not top of your priorities at the moment (my sympathies and best wishes) but I'm wondering whether we can find a solution to the formatting of . I can see the reasons why having a consistent format with  is a good idea, but until this edit of yours ODNBsub hadn't had brackets since Feb 2010. Adding brackets then meant that we ended up with double brackets when ODNBsub was used in the """"|format="""" parameter of , for example.  So, as a fix for now at least, I've added the formatting directly and eliminated the brackets. This means that people will need to add brackets if they want them but won't be stuck with double brackets.  It does mean that the brackets aren't in the same font style as the message, though (e.g. Boden Professor of Sanskrit election, 1860, which is still accepting comments at peer review by the way... ).

 The point of this section is your request to change the lead paragraph to play down the mentions of """"misogyny"""" is it not?

As such, the lead should describe that. The ethics issues are discussed and mentioned.

(r to my favorite editor, started before Spotfixer commented:)
Not months, years. He'd been shoveling that shit on Shapiro since 2006. Anyway, thanks for the kind words - coming from one in your time and place it's especially touching that you'd be aggrieved over my two week time out from a website.
I often despair of ever getting anything done here. The most basic, obvious, and straightforward applications of policy often take many man-hours, and even a victory never establishes any kind of precedent - the same discredited arguments are just brought to a new forum. Outright deceit goes unpunished; editors say X=100, citing a source that says X=-5, and get away with it. I mean, look at my own block log, for example.
The first time I was blocked, it was because a devotedly Jewish and obsessively Zionist admin baited me until he ran out of his 3 reverts - he actually put """"rv#1, rv#2, rv#3..."""" in his edit summaries - then, literally five minutes later, a notorious """"kamikaze edit warrior"""" with a laser-like focus on Israeli-Palestinian articles shows up to make his first ever edit to the article, I revert him, and then I've crossed the magic 3RR trip wire and I'm blocked. Ffs, even the guy that blocked me - who incidentally was a United States Air Force reservist with a combat record over Afghanistan - ended up scolding Humus Sapiens for his actions. But no sanctions, of course - that's reserved for people who say """"fuck"""" or click """"undo"""" four times instead of three, not for deranged ethno-nationalists who conspire in secret. Those types get admin bits instead, in honour of all the vandalism they've cleansed from articles about Pokemon.
The second time I was blocked, it was because I lost my temper with a semi-literate buffoon, who quoted in boldface """"huge numbers of Palestinians were also driven out of their homes by their own leaders and/or by Arab military forces"""" claiming it supported his text, """"the vast majority of Palestinians fled of their own accord."""" He quoted this triumphantly, as if he had convincingly refuted my argument and exposed me as a liar. The microcephale in question now appears to be on track to becoming an admin. He'll be in good company.
This is not an anomaly. Just prior to my block, I was working on the lede of our article on the 2008 Gaza war, which for some reason still bears a euphemistic title """"Israeli-Gazan conflict"""" or some such nonsense. The lede claimed that """"other Palestinian estimates differ"""" from the """"Hamas-run"""" Gazan hospital system; the only relevant article cited, a piece in the conservative """"home team"""" Israeli newspaper Jerusalem Post, actually noted a very close correlation between Ministry of Health estimates, endorsed by the World Health Organization, independent estimates, and even the Israeli estimate of overall fatalities (although IDF insists that the number of combatants was far greater, but only off the record and without specifics.) Two separate editors reverted my correction. I mean, how can we stand for this? Who the fuck cares about """"incivility"""" and """"personal attacks"""" when editors are lying about the content of sources and getting away with it? These people didn't read the sources. They didn't care about the sources. They just knew, because they wanted it to be true, that Palestinian casualty counts were all lies, so they edited the article to say so. I am sick of dealing with this kind of bullshit. What can I say, my patience is not unlimited.
I don't mean to make this out as if every editor who has a pro-Israel point of view is some kind of Satanic monster. I respect Steve/sm8900. I respect Avraham. I respect Ceedjee (and I still don't know where he stands except that he's downright mean to anybody who doesn't stand with him!) Hell, I even respect JayJG in my own twisted way, at least he's entertaining, if only in the fashion of a heel. But this endless stream of nonsense wears one down. I genuinely enjoy reasoned debate on talk pages, ok? But when people lie, cheat, dissemble, and filibuster, I'm going eventually to blow up. Deal with it.

(I note with irony my own advice to a newbie: Try and keep your cool, because WP seems to take an extremely hard line against """"incivility"""" from editors perceived as pro-Palestinian. They will always portray you as a crazy extremist, so it is best to support your arguments with solid """"mainstream"""" sources. [...] You have to be kind of single-minded, I think. Don't allow any opportunity for them to turn the discussion away from the real issues. Word your comments carefully so they cannot be twisted into some alternate interpretation to be used against you.

Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - Sino-Indian relations. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will continue helping to improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at Sino-Indian relations - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled """"Click here to contest this speedy deletion,"""" which appears inside of the speedy deletion ({{db-...}}) tag (if no such tag exists, the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate). Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit the the page's talk page directly to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact one of these administrators to request that the administrator userfy the page or email a copy to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia.

 criticism of jesus/plucking eyeballs out/slavery 

Jesus has been criticized as vindictive, intolerant, prudish, and unkind. Several scholars have noted that he appears to condone slavery.
 
−TABTAB 
−TAB
The cardinal Avery Robert Dulles stated that Jesus “said not a word against slavery as a social institution"""", and believes that the writers of the New Testament did not oppose slavery either.  In his paper published in Evangelical Quarterly, Kevin Giles notes that Jesus often encountered slavery, """"but not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery,” and argues that Jesus must have then condoned it.  
 
−TABTAB 

How come the Catholic removed this section in his words """"because it didn't appear to be criticism"""" is this a joke?  
−TAB
Friedrich Nietsche argued that “a war was declared on passion” in the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus says of sexual temptation: """"If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out."""" According to Nietsche, “Destroying the passions and cravings, merely as a preventive measure against their stupidity and the unpleasant consequences of this stupidity, today this itself strikes us as merely another acute form of stupidity. We no longer admire dentists who """"pluck out"""" teeth so that they will not hurt any more…. the Christian who follows that advice and believes he has killed his sensuality is deceiving himself: it lives on in an uncanny vampire form and torments in repulsive disguises.”[Friedrich Nietzsche, 1878, Human all too Human: A Book for Free Spirits, The Wanderer and His Shado, aphorism 83] """,1,0

Instead, you choose to act like a self-appointed wikipedia police, running about throwing up the blue flags of WP rules and being a generally obnoxious person with no real use. Instead of actually contributing useful original edits to articles you seem to think this is the old Newpedia where people are expected to submit edits for your approval. If too many others take the same tac WP will collapse into dross. You violate every rule in the book of which you accuse others. You are a mean spirited, very angry person that drives away editors with your sarcastic responses and general high-handed behavior. I suspect you have no real special knowledge of any of the articles upon which you squat like a vulture waiting tear apart others creative edits. You really need to crack a book and study up on a subject or two and find an article you feel needs rewriting and to straighten out the too turgid, redundant writing that exists here on WP. Stop trying to act like you are an administrator and grow up.

At a time when WP needs more editors, particularly female, you with your coarse, rude behavior is the last thing WP needs. You are, to summarize it, a net negative.  I am amazed that you have not been banned but I suppose your facility at quoting the rules, all while completely violating the spirit of WP preserves you.

 Re: Thanks for restoring links 
Hi; you're quite welcome. I didn't think you removed the interlanguage links intentionally. The spam/vandalism was indeed added by 221.197.20.66—the same spammer/vandal returned today via 221.198.74.212. Since this is an obvious (and shameless) attempt to use Wikipedia to increase the page ranking of the spammer's website (see Wikipedia:Spam), I've put in a request at m:Non-development tasks for developers#Spam regex requests to have the domain shop263.com added to the project-wide spam filter. With any luck, a developer will see the request before too long. Once the domain is on the filter, a page containing the domain cannot be saved (annoyingly, there are ways to get around this, but it usually takes care of the problem).

Anyway, nice work on the rewrite. I hope you like it here and choose to stick around! Cheers,   07:32, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)

 Zone system 

I would appreciate your leaving the mention in. First Ansel Adams, in his three volume 1980 basic photography series, presented the Zone system this way and he explicitly said, in so many words, that his aim is not to force his own system of photography on anyone, but to encourage photographers to better understand their equipment in order to control the finished photograph. He disapproved of winging it, not of any particular system. The Zone system worked for him. And the Zone system is controversial, believe it or not. I know of at least one vocational school photography teacher (years ago when I lived in Montreal) who told students not to bother with it, and it seems he was not alone. 

Also, please wait a few days before doing a major edit job. I liked the article as it used to be and I was sorely tempted to revert most of your changes, but did not. I particularly liked the wording """"dynamic range"""" and miss it, and I'm sorry to say I now personally find the article less approachable to a newcomer. 

Dynamic range is very appropriate: for instance (I'm making numbers up here for the sake of argument) if we say reality has a Zone 0 to X range of 1 to 100,000 , then a finished print has a range of 1 to 10,000 , while a typical digital camera will only provide a range of 1 to 1,000 . A move from 100,000 to 10,000 to 1,000 seems pretty dynamic to me...

However, since I'm not going to reread the whole Basic Photography series or even go into a darkroom again (space is at a premium in Tokyo) I'm not willing to put too much effort into maintaining this page.  05:52, 30 Sep 2004 (UTC)

Hi Vincent:
Which idea, specifically, did you wish to restore to the zone system article? That the zone system is/was not advocated by all? (I'd say that's probably true for most any school of thought.) That Ansel Adams was not dogmatic about this being the only way to do things? (I'd say that unless there is a large public misimpression that he was dogmatic it's not worth mentioning, no more than it's necessary to mention that every painter or sculptor or engineer held other approaches to various disciplines were equally valid.)

Here's the problem with """"dynamic range,"""" Vincent: it's inaccurate jargon. (It's oft-used and familiar jargon, but sloppy and inaccurate nonetheless.) First, it's redundant. The meaning most attribute to """"dy",0,0

Why are you removing the information I am adding if you're right? why are you removing information I add from the sources which contradict your claims. How did it lose more soilders when the article says the following: The intensity of the conflict and the inability to forsee a quick end to the conflict without involving considerable resources on the part of India to expel the Pakistani forces led Indian leaders to approach the United Nations who ultimately introduced Observers in June 1948. A UN brokered cease-fire went into effect on Jan 1, 1949. In all, 1,500 soldiers died on each side during the war and Pakistan was able to acquire roughly two-fifths of Kashmir which it established as Azad Kashmir, meaning free Kashmir.  This is taking about 1947 so how did Pakistan take a drubbing? when India was running to the United Nations for help? and when Pakistan had taken lad? how is that a drubbing? this is what I want to know.

 Hi . Wikipedia has a strict policy on how we write about living people. Wikipedia is one of the top 5 websites on the planet—if someone types anything in Google, Wikipedia will almost certainly be on the first page of results if we have an article about it. As a result, we have to pay special attention to living people. Anything we write about them can actually harm them in real life if it isn't backed up by high-quality reliable sources. In other words, we need to get the article right. And one important policy we have is that any poorly sourced negative information about living people should be removed. Next time, you need to back up your content with reliable sources—see Wikipedia:Citing sources and Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners for how to do this. We thank you for your interest in contributing to Wikipedia, however. Check out our introduction to editing for more information on how you can contribute constructively.   """,0,0

I noticed your involvement in the discussion and your revision of the article creator's illegal closure of the AfD discussion, and I agree that reverting it was the right thing to do, but I'm curious how all this transpired in the first place. As you can see, the article has been deleted, so technically the discussion can't continue any longer (unless an administrator decides to restore it on the grounds of sabotage). What I would like to know is why an administrator deleted it in the first place. How could he or she not have noticed that:
a) The article was closed by someone other than an administrator, and
b) That the discussion was nowhere near the proper minimal closing date of five days after the start of the AfD discussion.

Furthermore, what do you think might have been the creator's motive for declaring Delete as the final decision? None of this makes much sense to me: the hoaxer willingly has his article which he has been fighting to keep for a while deleted, and an administrator wrongly and prematurely deleted the article for some strange reason.

 Criticism Section - Not Clutch 

This section is basically about how Arod is not considered to be clutch. The section is outdated and irrelevant due to his performance in the 2009 playoffs. No one debates whether or not he is clutch anymore. This entire section should be deleted. Does anyone disagree?  — (talk • contribs)  
I'm thinking about this.  Some of it could be kept, if put in a historical perspective.  But it is clearly over the top as it is.   
I just reread this section, and it's completely outdated. I still think it should be removed in it's entirety.   
Some of it needs to be kept.  Let's discuss what should stay and what should go.  I'm totally okay with reducing the size of it, but it needs to be mentioned.   
I made some dramatic changes to the section, trying to shorten it and update it.  Also, I've tried to reorganize the section as it had obviously grown organically over a long period.  My efforts are by no means stellar, and I suggest people look at the section with new eyes to see how to further improve it.  
It is, at the least, a good start.  Thank you.  I'll take a closer look at it later.   
Nice updates. The section seems relevant again.   
I made some minor copyedits to the section. I think the section ought to stay included  it's part of Arod's historical record that he's come under fire for being """"un-clutch"""" (ludicrous as those criticisms may have been). I'm also going to remove the tag suggesting integrating the section elsewhere  the section hardly gives undue weight to the controversy, which extended over a period of several years and occupied who-knows-how-many back pages in the sports press. bomb 

 Range Factor 

The range factor claims currently tagged as as """"citation needed"""" can be verified on ESPN's page (and probably elsewhere). The claims as stated are accurate and verifiable. I'd add the cite, but on second thought I question whether it's really a useful thing to state. It makes it sound like that's the final word on his defense, which it surely isn't. Range factor isn't the only defensive stat, and A-Rod does not rank last on many of the others. To cite it exclusively feels like you're trying to push a point of view criticizing him defensively. (Also, even on range factor, in 2004 and 2005 he was tied for last, not alone.)   

 """"Youngest to hit 600"""" 

This stat is misleading, while he may be the youngest to achieve this he took an above average time to do so. He played 183 more games than Babe Ruth. Because Rodriguez started playing baseball at a much earlier age than many of the greats should be noted. He is a good player, but statements concerning his age should be taken out. Games played/Seasons are a better barometer of talent than age.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 170.123.4.230

That's a very a-historical point of view. The church was coming out with doctrinal statements about the trinity, and the Arians were twisting them and believing them. So the church went back and clarified what they meant. That's why some of the creeds are quite amazingly pedantic.

It's also a non-sensical point of view. You can't believe a bunch of words devoid of underlying meaning. You either believe them as they were meant, you mis-interpret them and thus mis-believe them, or you pretend to believe them. But there is no such thing as believing them without having a modicum of understanding. Sure you can believe some words are """"from God"""" but not know what they mean, but then you don't believe the doctrine you believe that there are some words that are true.

Apparently you didn't read what Augustine wrote. Let me refresh your memory...
""""Your today yields not with tomorrow, for neither does it follow yesterday. Your today is eternity; therefore You begat the Co-eternal, to whom You said, 'This day have I begotten Thee.' Thou hast made all time; and before all times You are, nor in any time was there not time.""""

Augustine directly links God being external to time with the begetting of the Son. Now if you have a  different point of view, prove it! Otherwise it is just hand-waving and show.

> Don't understand the sentence above. Pfortuny 

People are interested in the relationship between biblical doctrine and science. What is the problem with a ONE LINE reference?

>Now my question is, have any published theologians linked Einstein's theories 
>about time with the eternity of God?

There's plenty of people thinking about this issue. Lewis is a published theologian is he not? Here is a paper from a college dealing with it....

The doctrine of the church is important, but what it means is irrelevant? Come on!! Why look up Wik if not to find out what something means? You don't need Wik to read the Athanasian creed. You need Wik to *understand* it in its historical context.

> To answer your first question, the Church defines which beliefs are dogma

Then point me to where I can buy a book or books which is the final word on Christian dogma. Then I can verify for myself what parts of this article are dogma and which are opinion. Don't say the bible because it doesn't mention eternal generation.

>For Orthodox at least, it's a """"theological opinion"""" that Mary lived a sinless 
>life

Ah huh! But for Catholics it is DOGMA. Thus what is and isn't dogma the OPINION of different churches and persons.

At the end of the day folks, I have taken a quote from a church father that directly addresses the issue of """"eternally begotten"""" to explain to the reader the meaning. To take it down you would have to show either

a) Augustine was out of step with the rest of the church at this point.
b) The church was so confused, there are too many theories to discuss.

But to just say """"let it be a mystery! Don't tell them what it means!"""", sorry that doesn't wash.

You *ARE* indeed clueless. Yes, """"Ariana"""" is a different spelling for """"Aryana"""" which does indeed come from the Avestan's """"Aryanem Vaejo"""" (specifically, in Vandidad, Fargasht-e Yekom).  But the """"Aria"""" that you mention above is Greek for what is in Old Persian """"Haraiva"""" which is modern Herat (Hari-Rud).  Looks like you can't even read and understand a simple text in front of you.  The Greek """"Aria"""" has NOTHING TO DO with """"Arianem Vaejo"""".  Not even a single scholar has ever suggested that Arianem Vaejo is the same as """"Haraivo or the Greek """"Aria"""".  The Greek """"Aria"""" for Avestan/Old Persian """"Haraivo"""" is comparable to how in ancient greek text Hagmatana is written """"Ekbatana"""" or many other examples. The Old Persian satapry Hari-Rud (which was not called Hari-Rud in Old Persian) is clearly mentioned in both Darius I's Behistun Inscription as well as two of Xerxes' inscriptions.  """"Arianem Vaejo"""" on the other hand, is mentioned in the Avesta where I told you above, and numerous scholars have published works on the whereabouts of it (including our own late Dr. Bahram Farahvashi who has a full book by that title, called """"Iran Vij"""").  Nobody (other than our great scholar """"Zereshk"""" of course) thinks it is the same as Hari-Rud/Haraivo/greek """"Aria"""".  

As for """"aberoo"""", I honestly feel sad for you, because your beahviour and edits in Wikipedia clearly reveal that you suffer from an inferiority complex and nearly all your edits are about image and not about contents.  It is obvious that you try to present an image instead of contributing to contents.

I hesitated to do this without discussing it first, however I have often seen statements of encouragement for people to be somewhat fearless in making contributions.  I feel that a section on cost is another way to add context to the understanding of the size of a terabyte.  Since this measurement (terabytes) is most commonly used with reference to disk drives and since there is already a section on disk drive capacity, it seemed reasonable that there should also be a context to show how the cost of that capacity has changed over time.

I usually get a l lot of negative reaction when I introduce something with which lay readers are not familiar. 

I don’t have a pro-dictator bias. It just seems like that because I’m correcting articles that were already one-sided. History's not a pros and cons analysis anyway. Historians want to know why and how. 

Also, I don’t use one explanatory model (like Marxism, World Systems Theory, Dependency Theory, Modernization Theory, etc.) solely. I don’t keep my mind closed to one interpretation. 

If an article chronicles any facts, I leave them if they’re accurate. But they must be explained in a context. Statements like ‘he’s an authoritarian dictator bent on staying in power at all cost rejected by the international community’ will go in favor of statements like ‘because of his controversial policies he’s been ejected from the Commonwealth at Britain’s behest'. 

If an article mentions that Mugabe has been seizing white-owned farms it must also mention that 4,500 white farmers own 70% in the land in a country of 13 million. The article must also explain why land reform is a touted goal in the Third World. To many, that unacceptable because that's pro-Mugabe POVing. But quoting anti-Mugabe insults by as many famous people as possible is possible because it's a fact that they said those things. 

Some can’t tolerate that. To them, Mugabe persecutes homosexuals; he’s a racist; he subverts democracy; he cracks down against NGOs; he rigs elections; he’s unmitigated evil; and he does that because he’s evil. 

There are not that many social historians who would accept such simplistic, sweeping conclusions based on superficialities.",0,0

 Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Macedonia 2 

This arbitration case has been closed and the final decision is available at the link above.
All editors on Macedonia-related articles are directed to get the advice of neutral parties via means such as outside opinions and Geopolitical ethnic and religious conflicts noticeboard (WP:ECCN), especially since there are significant problems in reaching consensus.
All articles related to Macedonia (defined as any article that could be reasonably construed as being related to Macedonia, Macedonia nationalism, Greece related articles that mention Macedonia, and other articles in which how Macedonia will be referred to is an issue) fall under 1RR whenever the dispute over naming is concerned.  Editors enforcing a case where a binding Stalemate resolution has been found are exempt from 1RR.
The following users have been banned from Wikipedia  one year, one year, and six months .
The following users have been topic-banned from Macedonia-related articles and their talk pages, as defined in All related articles under 1RR: indefinitely, indefinitely, one year and, one year.
The Committee takes note that  has resigned his administrator status while this case was pending, but also notes that he is desysopped as a result of the above case. ChrisO may obtain the tools back via the usual means or by request to the Arbitration Committee.
 is strongly admonished for displaying a long pattern of incivil, rude, offensive, and insulting behavior towards other editors and failure to address the community's concerns in this regard. Because of this Future Perfect at Sunrise is subject to an editing restriction for one year, and is desysopped for three months as a consequence of poor user conduct and misuse of administrative tools. After three months, his administrator access will be automatically restored.
Single-purpose accounts are strongly advised to edit in accordance with WP:SPA and other Wikipedia policies. Diversifying one's topics of interest is also encouraged.
Abuse filter 119, as currently configured, logs all changes involving the word """"Macedonia"""" but does not block any edits. The community is strongly advised to consider adding a new abuse filter criterion; any instances of changing the word """"Macedonia"""" to """"FYROM"""" (the five-letter acronym, not the full phrase) shall be prevented. 
Within seven days of the closure of this case, a discussion is to be opened to consider the preferred current and historical names for the four entities known as Macedonia. The discussion will end one month after it is opened.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
You have been blocked from editing for a period of 31 hours for your disruption caused by edit warring and violation of the three-revert rule at The Amazing Race 21. During a dispute, you should first try to discuss controversial changes and seek consensus. If that proves unsuccessful you are encouraged to seek dispute resolution, and in some cases it may be appropriate to request page protection. If you would like to be unblocked, you may appeal this block by adding the text  below this notice, but you should read the guide to appealing blocks first. Bbb23 (talk) 
I love how two editors can gang up on a third, including being so nasty that one of them draws a block for incivility, and it's me who ends up getting fucked by their bad faith actions. Excellent evidence for the proposition that when you give anyone a little power they'll abuse it. Great decision. Spot fucking on. Buck Winston (talk) 
[edit]Hmm

(Non-administrator observation) I've only taken a cursory look at the article, but it looks like you made a good point - I can only think of a handful of shows to have featured three gay characters in a season, and I'd agree with you that it should definitely be put in that category. Regardless, if you plan on making more edits like this and this, you might find yourself with a block extension. Bbb23's a good administrator, and 3RR's called """"bright-line rule"""" for a reason. And considering that edit-warring blocks are to get users to cool down, if this is how you responded, it looks like he made the right call. — Francophonie&Androphilie;(Je vous invite à me parler)

There are many examples of articles on this website that provide info about controversial issues in a neutral position while usually providing material for and against the issue. I think that that would be the only way to present a truly fair and neutral portrayal of Max Muller. One other consideration for yourself would be what is you consider a mainstream opinion, because I am sure that you are aware of the politics that goes into getting a paper published and the biases that can play for or against it. Finally, your vehement refutation of other sources based on """"who is he?"""" shows your own inability to question and research into ideas contradictory to others.

Killer, I'm sorry that you have misread my unblock request. If you re-read it you will see that my use of """"pop-eyed chihuahua"""" there refers specifically, accurately and unequivocally to the dog displayed on your user page and not to you. I cited it to explain to why I used that imagery in the WP:PA, as otherwise it would appear inexplicably random. The explanation was not, as you seem to think, offered in mitigation. Indeed my original unblock request, which I condensed at the request of admin Hersfold, stated: 

The following will help the reviewing admin(s) to understand what otherwise would appear to be a random choice of metaphors.[...] Killer has a picture of a pop-eyed chihuahua dog on her user page,  captioned “I look like this”; and she is in the habit of referring to herself, in her sysopping summaries, as a dog   e.g. “Puppy has spoken.” Stupidly I exploited this canine imagery at Killer’s expense.'' 

I edited out that section along with others in an effort to comply with Hersfold's request.

My unblock request in no way implies that it is 'somehow OK to insult' you because you refer to yourself as 'puppy'. It simply explains where the idea for the canine imagery came from. It does not attempt to excuse my using it to insult you.

I have apologised, and still do, for my rude and offensive references to you personally in the WP:PA; and ask that you graciously accept my apology as sincere, which it is.   """,1,0

 Triple tags 

I've updated a broken link in this section.  However, as far as I can tell, none of the links demonstrate the history of triple tags as described in this section - they don't disprove it either, they're just several isolated posts talking about tags of a similar form, making no reference to one another.

 """"Q: Microsoft encourages developers to build Web sites that incorporate Silverlight.

The problem we have at the moment is that the entire section needs sourcingand while I have sources for some of it, many of these are not sources I will link to in a wiki article.  The alumni sites for example are run very well and would certainly meet sourcing requirements, but also have individuals personal information on them and I'm strongly against linking to those as sources, especially as the new website does not provide links to the alumni pages, but let's alumni voluntarily provide information about themselves.
I had planned to go up the school at somepoint soon and use the library copies of old yearbooks and check and cite thoseI also think that the school does have alumni information, I'm just wrong about where it is kept.
But from what I could find on Megan Follows didn't give me any reason to remove it that I didn't have for every other alumni who isn't cited.

The death certificatenot my original researchsays """"Date of Suicide September 16,"""" as does the police report, Coroners Report, and Inquest. The date of death given as September 18, 1932, is because that was when she was DECLARED DEAD by the coroner. If the coroner had not examined the body for another hour and eleven minutes, Peg's death date would have been recorded as September 19, for he would have declared her dead at 12:01 AM, yet the date of suicide would remain September 16, for the coroner knew the rate of decay. That was the way it was done in 1930s Los Angeles....The coroner knew what he was doingGwen didn't. I have official documents provided to me by the City of Los Angeles, yet Gwen would rather what? Use a newspaper as a more verifiable source than these, or just pick one section of the death certificate without reading the entire document? Has she even read it? All of it? Why am I even having this discussion?

As it stands now, the article contains a good deal of ambiguity, whereas before it had very little. And once again, I raise the concern that the article was argued over, discussed, and a concensus agreed to by numerous long-time editors such as Rossrs and Wildhartlivie, and, if I remember, Pinkadelic.

I care about Wikipedia, too, and I am concerned about unverifiable entries making their way into any article. I fully remember when Wiki was the laughing stock of the Internet and scholarship in general. Did you see how many pages Gwen used up in the """"View History"""" and then had the nerve, the gall, to tell me she """"tweaked"""" it? She didn't tweak it, she rewrote the damn thing. And would it not have been a polite courtesy to first talk over all the edits? This, more than anything, is why there are so many ill feelings between contributors on Wiki. Too many are simply too head strong to think, """"Wait a sec, so and so has obviously done a lot of work here, maybe I should talk some things over with him  to reach a concensus and make a better article.""""

Hi Ma'am, I really appreciate your politeness in addressing my edits and also explaining to me kindly about the issue. I now understand it. However, I would like to submit that the sacred texts like the Yajurveda, Rigveda and the Bhagavad Gita are accepted as authoritative texts on the Hindu religion by a majority of the Hindus. These three texts, namely, the Yajurveda, the Rigveda and the Bhagavad Gita are a part of Hinduism and not just Vaishnavism. To describe my edits as purely a """"Vaishnavite"""" point of view means that the sacred texts like the Yajurveda, the Rigveda and the Bhagavad Gita are not a part of Hinduism. The language used by me only state the facts of Hindu Religion and not a """"POINT of View"""" of Vaishnavism. For Example, the Quran declares Allah as the Supreme God. Now if this is mentioned, it is not a point of view but a fact that the Quran describes Allah in that manner.  talk""",0,0

Trenton Ontario Page

The page is simply incorrect.  However Blotto adrift believes he has an monopoly over it.  When several different users correct it he complains to an admin and you block IP address'.  Please if you are going to block someone in the future please look into BOTH sides.  The trenton ontario page is incorrect and it will stay that way until you stop siding with Blotto Adrift.  This is not the only page users have complained about Blotto adrift changing.  I am here to help wikipedia by correcting mistakes.  This will only improve this sites poor view.  However if admins do not look into the actions of all users this site will only go down hill.

Greetings. According to your contribution history[1], the only edit you have made before today was to Rush last July. You have never edited Trenton nor any other article to do with places in Canada so what are talking about? Malcolmxl5 (talk) 

hmmm.... I did last week before I was blocked. 

anyways I would like the trenton ontario page to be corrected.  Please do a search on scholars portal to find the several journal articals by J.Mickelakos.... then Blotto will say how do we know he's from trenton?  

It is sad that one of the only scholars this town has is not added because of the jealousy a user has when someone corrects his edits 

Protecting Blotto adrift
You will find every way to protect Blotto adrift instead of correcting an error on a page.  I am here to help wikipedia and you seem not interested in this. 

Like I said before, he is sited in many journals.  Also scholar portal has over 500 000 journals google  less than 1000, so how is he to be sourced?  Also please see York's part time professor list in tthe calendar. 

That's 'cited', not 'sited', by the way. Happy days.   

I will await your apology – and the apology from others Thank you

 From Norway; Denmark; Iceland; Scotland; England(Bristol etc.); Wales; Ireland; Basques & Others(""""again"""",more data) 

by Gunnar Thompson

""""On DeVirga's map, the northwestern continent is called """"Norveca.""""  This title, appearing under the symbol of a crown, identifies the huge land as a province under the sovereignty of Norway.  Other maps also show a huge land attached to northern Norway.  On the 14th-century Andreas Walsperger map, the region is called """"Regnii Norwegie"""" (the realm of Norway); maps by Sebastian Munster (1532) and Joachim Von Watt (1534) call the region """"Septentrio;"""" a circular map by Battista Agnese 1543 shows """"Terra Nova"""" extending from Norway to the North Pole.  

Maps that portray a huge northern territory reflect the 1261 proclamation of King Haakon IV extending Norse sovereignty over all the lands from Norway to the North Pole.  The """"North Pole"""" he had in mind was the magneticnot the geographic pole.  A 14th-century writer, Philippe de Mezieres, reported that Norway's overseas realm was so extensive that it took three years for the king's tax collectors to complete their rounds and return to Bergen.  

One of the territories that Haakon annexed in a 1262 treaty along with Greenland and Iceland was an otherwise obscure place called landanu or """"New Land.""""  The Kongfriget Norges historie (1778) identified an Icelander named Rolf as the discoverer of this New Landalso known as Nyalandin 1258.  It was also identified as part of the North American mainland.  Bishop Gissur Einarsson noted that the direction of sailing to Nyaland from Iceland was southwest.  In that direction lies Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  

The region had many names that changed over the years as successive waves of Europeans landed on its shores.  As late as 1347, Icelanders referred to Newfoundland as """"Markland""""which was an ongoing source of lumber.  Sailors from Bristol called the coastal isles """"the Icelands.""""  Circa 1350, a Spanish Franciscan reported an isle called """"Ibernia"""" in the northwest Atlantic that was under Norse sovereignty.  After that date, Bubonic Plague swept through European cities devastating maritime centers.  Norway was particularly hard hitforcing the abandonment of overseas colonies.  English, Portuguese, French, German, and Danish merchants fought over the western isles.  After 1380, Denmark took control of Greenland, Iceland, and mainland in eastern Canada.  The """"new"""" Danish mainland appears on the Claudius Clavus map of 1424 as """"Gronlandia Provincia.""""  Thus, the name """"Norveca"""" was already archaic by the early 15th century when it found its way onto DeVirga's map.  Portuguese maps of the early 16th century feature the names of Joao Fernandes (The Labrador) and the Corte-Real family along the East Coast of North America...""""  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 212.113.163.75   
Gunnar Thompson has also published on Marco Polo’s secret missions to Canada and the ancient Egyptian colonization of Mexico. He has compiled an """"Extensive collection of evidence (maps, artifacts, and cultural similarities) of voyages to North America before Columbus, by Phoenicians, Norse, Celts, Britons, Jews, Greeks, Irish, Romans, Japanese, Hindus, Indo-Sumerians, and Chinese. Native Americans are the first discoverers, occupying the Americas for at least 300,000 years."""" (from the Laura Lee radio show website) He is as reliable a source as Gavin Menzies. He has told me that the word hurricane comes from the ancient Greek.   

Well, the dear Dougweller can claim quite rightly in many cases that the relate of Marco Polo could be speculation, however Gunnar Thompson cites the words of his own reporting and book, book attributed to him, Marco Polo, as a documental source for these claims in the American Pacific coast, as well as indirect sources more speculative on the several centuries later(and even from his time) world maps, wich indicate where the lands designated by the Chinese and by the Venetian-Dalmatian Explorer were.

 I was thinking about this last night, and came to two conclusions: First, focusing solely on this article is not the way to go.

[Don't tell me GW is FA and is therefore academically rigorous; the FA star does not even come within discus-throwing distance of establishing an article as """"academically rigorous.""""]. Second, your system of defending this Wikipedia page (notice I didn't say """"article"""") is completely airtight, because you hold control over all of the definitions. Join any high school debate team and they'll tell you, if you own the definitions, you own the debate. And the problem here is this: you define anyone who disagrees with AGW as a """"denialist""""; and you define everyone who agrees with you as an """"expert."""" Done! The page is impregnable. Take forex the quote by Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. Using her comments as supporting evidence of the page's (not """"article's) thesis is a flagrant act of POV that proves this page (not """"article"""") is an op-ed piece from start to end. Barbara Boxer is a politician. Every bit of power, money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only: to characterize herself as a noble public servant, and stereotype her opponents as villains, buffoons or both. Even more — and this is important — Barabara Boxer is not a run-of-the-mill politician. It would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is. In short, the Boxer quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the """"so what?"""" test. I intend to delete that one sometime soon too.

 Germany -  four entries 

You did not respond to my argument at all - please read it more carefully:

The IOC cannot be seen as the single authoritative source on this article, as the IOC itself does not publish all-time tables, and publishes only unofficial tables per single Games. Therefore this article is in violation with WP:No original research! The official source for the German National Olympic Committee (DOSB) does list the Olympic Medals for Germany from 1896 to 2012 → .

There were no official country codes before 1976: Only in 1976 did the IOC start to assign standardized codes. Before that time, the local Organizing Committees of each Olympic Games had chosen codes, often in the local language, resulting in a multitude of codes.

At the Games of 1956, 1960, and 1964 the German team was simply known as """"Germany"""" and the usual country code of (GER) was used. Yet, the IOC code EUA is currently applied in hindsight in the IOC medal database, without further explanation given. 

Yugoslavia does not exist anymore as a country - the FRG does. The (FRG) Federal Republic of Germany did not cease to exist. It was a simple code change, same country, same NOC. NO alternate NOCs: EUA, FRG and GER have always had the same German National Olympic Committee (NOC) recognized in 1895, same NOC President (Willi Daume, 1960–1993), same Olympic Committee located in Frankfurt - only the codes have changed. Germany is officially still called (FRG), the Federal Republic of Germany - it's the same country, with the same NOC since the first modern Games held in 1896 - only the GDR had a separate NOC, because it was a separate country (although not recognized by Germany). """"West Germany"""" did never exist, and is nothing more than the common English name used for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG. The """"enlarged"""" Federal Republic of Germany (known simply as """"Germany"""") is thus the continuation of the pre-1990 Federal Republic of Germany - the very same country, with the same National Olympic Committee since 1895.

It is, after all, from these types of sources that time lines are constructed. Beneath my cynical tone (as it strikes me now in retrospect) was the idea that one can't infer too much from sources, as such inference might amount to original research. If a source says that X is characteristic of the 21st century or of modernity in general, that source (at least in principle) certainly may be used to help put the 2010s decade (insofar as it is part of the 21st century and of modernity) into context. Statement X just shouldn't be used clearly to characterize item A on Wikipedia, when it clearly is meant to characterize item B in the source. This probably is what I should have said back in January, and I apologize for making my case in such an inflected voice. Also, I take it that your first language is not English, so I should have been more sensitive to the possibility of unintentional offense. While I don't know for a fact that you took offense at all, I'm troubled by the correspondence between our discussion and your departure from the project. Please, once more, accept my sincere apologies for any actions on my part that might have discouraged your participation.",0,0

Thank you for your reports at Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism. I find that you are a reliable contributor, and frequently make useful reports. However, you do sometimes seem a little too quick to jump straight to final warnings and AIV without milder warnings first. It is certainly not necessary to always go through the whole sequence of level 1 warning, level 2, level 3, level 4, but in almost all cases there should have been at least a couple of warnings, and an immediate """"final warning"""" to a new user without previous warnings should be reserved for extreme cases, such as serious personal attacks. One other point is that it is worth thinking whether """"vandalism"""" is always the right label. For example, you warned and reported Brendo1337 for vandalism, but to me his/her editing looked more like experimenting than vandalism, and a word of advice to experiment in the sandbox instead of an article may perhaps have been sufficient. I certainly do not wish to put you off, as you make very useful contributions to vandal fighting, as I have already said. However, you may find it helpful to consider my suggestions.

He uses the term loosely since it’s not a real printed comic. He has no examples of his drawing, what kind of cartoonist doesn’t put their work online. PROVE THAT SHIT!

He stated in this post to Wikipedia that his book Battle Neverending’s 3 thousand copies sold out in one year which is a total lie. He printed them in 1998 and was still selling them as recent as 2006

http://www.popocculture.com/28/battle-neverending-by-saab-l

“Jarvis Marlow is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing (one thousand copies) and third printing (two thousand copies) of Battle Neverending. I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year”. 

(Example #1 of his lies)

2000 copies of A.D. supposedly sold in one year or as Saab states (Record Time) which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings.
The first A.D. was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted.

“However, his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at San Francisco State University, A.D., which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997.”

When in reality

“Lofton wrote """"A.D."""" while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid”.

(Example #2 of his lies)

I ‘m not admitting any mistake about BERKELEY (you always want to appear very radical so I’m sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of Berkeley) because you made that up as well as being homeless! The only place you’ve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB, IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE!

(Example #3 of his lies)

“In all the WEEKS you've been STALKING me, NOT ONE motherfucker has so much as e-mailed me and asked, """"is this anonymous, psuedonym-using piece of shit correct about anything?""""”.

I know nobody reads your shit anyway so I wouldn’t expect any response. I write these things simply because I know that you can’t handle risking your supposed fame! (Which is all you are interested in anyway). Your not an activist you’re an opportunist masking yourself in anarchy.

And finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass!

Here’s the dialog about shutting Saabs Wikepedia page because firstly it’s chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that he’s just another home publishing hack!

I've looked into the books listed in the bibliography... The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted. The second was described by Pop Occulture Magazine as """"obviously a low-budget and quite-possibly home-printed affair"""". There is no evidence that either of these books received a credible review, much less meet WP:BOOK. Journalists are a dime-a-dozen and not automatically notable, and these books don't appear to establish notability either.

Therefore I am proposing deletion of the article. If the tag is remove, would someone please nominate for deletion? I can't as I can't create the deletion page... 67.67.219.223 (talk)

History of Primal Therapy article

I read through the recent discussions on Talk:Primal_therapy. I also added two more comments to the Talk:Arthur_Janov page. Did you send an email enquiry? The 1973 date for France D's marriage to Art is without credibility. After the divorce, to Vivian's great credit, she avoided the temptation to publicly humiliate Arthur Janov. After all, he wrote in the original Primal Scream: """"It is instructive to note that married couples who have both gone through Primal Therapy have never separated."""" (chapter 12). And according to France D. Janov's own admission in the Primal Center's Video Series 2, she enrolled at the Primal Institute because excessive marihuana use had broken down her gates. So it's a fact that Art married a former patient.

My feeling is that despite being tagged as a stub, the content of the Arthur Janov article is just about right for an encyclopedia entry. It isn't really the place to dissect Janov's reputation. I know it happens in other Wikipedia biographies, but in many cases it has got out of hand. I agree with your suggestion on the Primal therapy Talk page that this kind of material belongs in a separate History of Primal Therapy article. The Conocer piece doesn't strike me as a sound source of verifiable information, so I put together some links to articles which can be found online:

If you type Emotional Intelligence into Google the No.1 result is Steve Hein's eqi.org website. He interviewed a former patient who attended Arthur Janov's Primal Center in the late 1990's. You can find his interview notes here, labelled """"cautionary note"""".

Janov's bio on the Primal Center website states: """"The latest research conducted at Dr. Janov’s Primal Center on the effects of Primal Therapy on the brain was performed by Dr. Erik Hoffman, former Professor of Neurophysiology at Copenhagen University."""" You can read  what Erik Hoffmann, Ph.D., is doing now at Hoffmann's website.

On this page you can find a transcript of Dr. E. Michael Holden's account of what happened to him after he left the Primal Institute.

Carol Mither's book, Therapy Gone Mad, identifies case histories from Janov's first two books that were written by defendants in the lawsuits against The Center for Feeling Therapy.  Simon ( )

Thanks, Simon - Why can't you create an account like normal Wikipedians complete with a talk page? I don't think the History idea will come to much, There is just insufficient well sourced information to make much out of it - especially in view of Cgingold's latest analyses on the Primal Therapy talk page regarding derogatory statements about living individuals. I have already read the Michael Holden swan song twice - sad case.  

You seem to be applying two standards of evidence. The Primal Therapy article gives an outline of primal theory based on Arthur Janov's books alone, which were written to attract paying customers to his exclusive and expensive private treatment center. Last September, I wrote in the Primal Therapy talk page: Will the article have something to offer readers who want to know about Stettbacher's method, or the International Primal Association, or the plethora of copycat primal centers that flourished in the 1970s? There is sufficient well sourced information available for a history article  for a start, two books about The Center for Feeling Therapy, Erik Hoffmann's bio, and the transcript of Dr. E. Michael Holden's audio tape which was played a number of times at the IPA convention in 1983. The books by Carol Mithers and Tomas Videgård are already referenced in the main article. I have a copy of Videgård's book, by the way. Also, Professor Steven Rose wrote a one-page account of his research with Arthur Janov in Lifelines:
""""As Janov had hoped, it turned out that before therapy, the quantity of these particular receptors in his client's platelets was considerably below normal. Within six months of therapy, clients' depression had lifted, and the biochemical and immunological measures I was making approached the average for 'normal' non-depressed people of the same age and sex.""""
Further down the same page he added:
""""I obtained similar biochemical results when, a couple of years later, I did a similar study with depressed clients going through other, less dramatic forms of psychotherapy, so I suspect that in such cases the therapist matters more than the therapeutic theory.""""

Hi.

The Springboard source is not a blog; it is a column by Windows IT Pro, and it is written by Paul Thurrott. It has all three elements of a reliable source: Credible author, credible publisher and contents itself. 

Unlike what you think, it was not a set of """"abstract techniques""""; it was tangible changes visible to laymen end-user ([[a new version of Windows Firewall, a new version of Internet Explorer 6 and the famous Windows Security Center.) Windows XP Service Pack 2 was in important milestone because at the time Microsoft was under full-scale global scrutiny about the state of security in its products.

Hi, first comment on wiki so hopefully this works.  Can someone put a better picture of City Hall and Nathan Phillips square up?  That photo is atrocious.  It almost makes me think that whoever put it up hates the square (as some do) and wants to show it's ugly, concrete side (which is does have to some degree).  However, on any given day there are usually a lot of people in the square, either skating in the winter, or at some sort of exhibition in the summer (where there are also leaves on the trees, making the concrete seem a bit less onerous).  I'll try to get around to taking a pic, but I lost my camera recently, so in the meantime if anyone has one, please do swap them.  Thx.

 Removing """"Perhaps best known""""  from Judah Friedlander‎ 

Hello,

The issue isn't that a person is best known for something, as long as a WP:RS can be located, it's the formulation """"Perhaps best known"""" which seems to be widely used as a way of avoiding finding a RS for something the editor wishes to say. Personally I thought it was Wikipedia:WEASEL, but a discussion at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Perhaps_an_expression_of_doubt_or_a_weasel.3F suggested Peacock was a better way of looking at them.

 Legal Action Against Wikipedia 

I've heard that rumors that legal action is being started against wikipedia as a result of this article for the following reasons:

1- the SCIMD sheild being used on this article is a copyrighted image that they refuse to remove even at the request of the holder of the copyright hence they are in violation of copyright laws.

2- Wikipedia and the users involved in editing this page, are being added to one (if not more) of the lawsuits due to the constant slander of the students and SCIMD in attempts to hurt the current and future student body?

> any comments from the posters on the above and the fact that letters from the lawyers for the school, copyright holder, and one of the lawsuits have been ignored repeatedly?

just curious 

 

To be honest, why would or should anyone care about rumors or random unsubstantiated threats from anyone on the internet? The apparent copyright status of the image is documented on the image page; anyone is welcome to comment about it there, but nobody has done so, or use any of the other mechanisms to resolve copyright concerns about media files. You should read WP:THREAT before continuing down this line of discussion.  

it is by no means a theat against anyone.  I was just curious as i had heard about the legal action being taken, and curious as to why no one else had commented about it or why nothing was done.  People are quick to post the negative and not question.  I also understand and see that if anyone trys to defend this school or post anything positive their accounts are removed and the conversation erased claiming vandalism or something else obscure, so i'm pretty sure this will be erased and my account and IP will be banned in typical fashion to surpress anything that doesn't conform.  

Sorry for jumping at you...I think I've been reading on-line ranters too long, and completely misread your intent.  

 Has anyone heard any rumors that SCIMD sued several editors, had its claims dismissed immediately, and was forced to pay damages as a result of bringing a facially unmeritorious lawsuit?  If anyone has heard any such rumors, do they have any comment?   

More seriously, Azrealist, I don't believe """"rumors"""" of a lawsuit  have you heard anything involving (1) what court the suit was filed in, (2) who was sued, and (3) what the case number was?  If not, I would assume that whoever told you the rumor was probably just some disgruntled person with a connection to SCIMD, trying to discourage editors from posting here.  (I'm not questioning your good faith, but I'm betting whoever told you the rumor is an SCIMD apologist . . .)   

From what i heard the suit or charges were being started/processed in NJ and Florida concomitantly with the other suits in progress. Sorry but i don't have anymore info than that.  If i knew all the facts i wouldn't have asked about it. 

I once heard some rumors that a poster on this talkpage did not understand anything about fair use and thought copyright meant that no one could use an image. Care to comment on that Azrealist? -[[User_talk:AKMask|ask]]  
I love how americans commit a crime or violate some law and then hide behind or claim freedom and the right to do so as a result of one of the amendments. 
Are you honestly saying that pointing out that someone did not break the law is not a valid response to accusations of breaking the law? Might want to brush up either on the legalities of the situation (Wikipedia is hosted in Florida, all it's data is in florida, ergo the only law that matters is the US national and Florida state laws) or maybe the English language, if you meant something else with your statement. -[[User_talk:AKMask|ask]]  """,0,0

15. “During this period, Oswald began to consider returning to the Soviet Union or going to Cuba.” There is a no source cited here because it is impossible to know Oswald’s considerations. We can hypothesize but it is better to present the facts and let the reader do their own thinking. The statement is not fair because it grasps at the bounds of the imagination by assuming that the Mexico trip took place. Since that entire incident was even questioned by the Warren Commission’s own investigator  into the incident, Wesley Liebeler, the alleged Mexico trip cannot be used as basis for the conclusion that Oswald wanted to move to Russia or Cuba.

16. “The [pamphlet] trial got news media attention…” There was no trial. Oswald pled guilty to disturbing the peace and paid a $10 fine. (Warren Report vol. XXV p.117 Exhibit 2216.) The “ARREST” go media attention. Notably absent from the wikipedia paragraph is his strange relationship with FBI Agent John Lester Quigley, the first person to visit Oswald in jail.

17. “…Jim Garrison in his unsuccessful attempt to link Oswald to wealthy local businessman Clay Shaw.” His attempt was very successful. HSCA noted the credibility of Garrison’s link from Shaw to Oswald. It called the Clinton witnesses whom saw the two together. “The Committee found that the Clinton witnesses were credible and significant.” (HSCA Report page 171.)

18. Concerning Oswald and David Ferrie, “However, there is no credible evidence they had any significant contact when Oswald was a teenager.” The source cited is footnote #72, HSCA vol. IX p.103-115. While it would be correct to quote HSCA’s conclusion it is an outright lie to state this as a fact. In addition to the photo of Ferrie and Oswald together the Warren Commission took the testimony of Oswald’s high school classmates Fredrick O’ Sullivan (WC vol. VIII p. 27) and Edward Vobel (WC vol. VIII p.1) whom both testified to 15 year old Oswald and Ferrie meeting. Why would the Warren Commission be asking specifically about Ferrie if there was “no credible evidence”? There is also no mention of Ferrie’s motive for being with the teenage CAP. He would attempt to recruit teenage boys to molest. Both pro and anti conspiracy researchers including the Warren Commission have questioned Oswald’s sexuality due to his association with gay men in New Orleans.

19. “… [The Clinton witnesses] contained numerous contradictions to their testimony at the Clay Shaw trial in 1969, and to their testimony to the Committee in 1978.” Wikipedia editors hypocritically claim there is not enough space to include all facts and theories yet there is plenty of space to attack the Clinton LA witnesses again and again and again and again and again. Worse yet this statement is NOT in quotations as a conclusion of Gerald Posner as cited in Footnote #73. It is written in the article as an objective fact. If you are going to use statements from Posner then put them in quotations as HIS conclusions NOT facts.

 
 Return to Dallas 

20. “Oswald was last seen by a co-worker alone on the sixth floor of the Depository about 35 minutes before the assassination.” Another outright lie. Footnote #84 has cited the Warren Commission testimony of Charles Givens. The last witness to affirmatively see Oswald before the assassination was Carolyn Arnold in the lunch room at 12:15. (WC vol. XXII p. 635.) She was also interviewed by reporter Anthony Summers in ‘Conspiracy’ page 108. This lie speaks volumes as to Wikipedia’s intentions. They would rather mention a less significant witness simply to get in the statement of a “brown bag.”

  
In ‘Crossfire’ Jim Marrs attempts to present an even more detailed hypothesis for Oswald’s movements before the assassination but much of this is based on loose interpretations of witness statements.

It is very significant that Oswald was the ONLY employee whom did not eat their lunch outside or by a window in anticipation of the motorcade. Instead he stuck deep inside the depository in the 2nd floor lunchroom by the only accessible phone. The same room he was found in only 90 seconds after the assassination by Roy Truly and ML Baker. In ‘The Day Kennedy Was Shot’ Jim Bishop claimed Oswald salivated for 30 minutes by the sixth floor window awaiting the motorcade. This is obviously contradicted by both Carolyn Arnold and Bonnie Ray Williams whom ate his lunch by the assassination window until 12:15 or 12:20 before joining his friends on the 5th floor. His chicken bones were later found by police. (CWC)",0,0

Fans tell me that you and your great site claimed that the page they have created was to much promotion, so I have a question for you if I give you guys information about my artist Shabazz Sallier can you unlock his name and add the information onto your site the best way you can without anything sounding like it's trying to promote my artist Shabazz Sallier because he deserves a page just like anyone else on this planet.   Please let me know all of the options that I will have thanks so much Wikipedia I really appreciate it a lot you can always email at [email deleted]   

Hello  Please understand that nobody """"deserves a page just like anyone else on the planet"""". Wikipedia isn't a publicity medium, should never be used for that purpose, and has strict guidelines for inclusion of articles about people. If you just want a page, then please use Facebook.

WP:MUSICBIO describes criteria that a musician must meet before meriting an article on Wikipedia. And for an article (especially a biography article) to be accepted, it must meet the requirements summarized in Wikipedia:Golden rule.

The deleted article had been restored by request and resubmitted through Wikipedia:Articles for creation, but it was rejected as being promotional and having absolutely no reliable sources. Subsequently, the user who tried to improve it was banned for block evasion, and the draft article was deleted (users who evade a block have their contributions removed). Sending me similar material will not get an article created; if it isn't acceptable, it cannot be posted to article space.

You are welcome to go to Wikipedia:Articles for creation and try again. This is the only realistic venue for someone with a conflict of interest such as yourself. Bear in mind the criteria at WP:MUSICBIO for the artist, and Wikipedia:Golden rule for the article itself. ~  """,0,0

Another thing: without accurate information on Reserved names in NTFS, this article is of questionable value to anyone attempting to learn about NTFS to conduct forensics on an NTFS volume.  i.e. if you tell them """"there's no way to create a file named aux"""", when clearly there is a way, that is both inaccurate and misleading, ending up wasting a lot of time in an investigation.

 Good policy suggestion on class assignments. 

My sympathies about your encountering a class assignment that has gone badly awry. I think your  looks like a good idea, and I support it. It's especially regrettable that we are not receiving more well sourced, thoughtful edits to psychology articles here, as most of those articles badly need better sourcing and more coherent editing to represent current established knowledge from a neutral point of view. Keep up the good work.   (talk, ) 

 An appology is in order 

Dear Colin,

I am not sure if you will have the chance to read this, or if you'll have a moment to respond, but I am a student in the University of Toronto and specifically one of the 1700 psychology students mentioned in the article.  However before I go any further, may I express my most sincere and deepest appologies to you and everyone involved. I will not try to make excuses for my actions, nor will I try to do so for my fellow students as I do not speek for them. I realise (and no doubt others will too) that what we left behind was unbecoming of a sutdent at U of T.  And most importantly, I realise that we did as future scholars was wrong.

I know that you and you colleagues are considering taking extreme measures to ensure the content of Wikipedia stays secure as a responce to our actions. Though I can understand where you are coming from, I do not believe that this will solve any of your problems and will only make things worse in the long-run.  I see this situation as a systemic error on both of our sides, but as a first year student I have very little educational and social clout to enforce my statement. I am asking as both an avid reader of Wikipedia and as a lover of knowledge, please do not black-out our privaleges to use and edit articles.  Let us both use this experience as a steping stone to learn how to go about doing this in a constructive manner benefits Wikipedia and my school. 
 
Looking to make this a better place,

CivCodex 
  
Thanks. We have no issues with people who are interested in Wikipedia coming to edit Wikipedia. What seems to be the issue is when we have a large group of students editing Wikipedia not for the love of knowledge but simply for marks. These students do not stay around and seem to plagiarize at a high rate.   (talk · contribs · email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 
Have replied on your talk page. °Talk 

 Proposed new policy  

I'd like to advertise this (very draft) proposed new policy: . 

Comments please. °Talk 
 I think the central dillema is this: a student could make a poor-quality contribution that harms Wikipedia but then recieve partial or full credit. If the grading rubric was accurate, a student would receive 0 or negative credit. My personal solution has been to engage with professors to try and influence the assignment, increase their Wikipedia knowedge, and improve the grading rubrics themselves. I'm fairly proud of Education Program:Saint Louis University/Signal Transduction (SP13), which I helped write. You might want to ask   

 There should also be some sort of policy re: how the community reacts to profs and students.  The active community is more likely to be aware of and act on policies, in the first place; and we are often more unkind than necessary, in the second.  
 I proposed an alternative idea on the assignments talk page - as an example of the sort of implementation that I would hope is compatible with any policy we adopt.  –  +

Mjpresson initiated the ANI proceedings and got other editors riled up so another editor took care of the formality of proposing a ban; check it out if you want to verify that.

Congratulations to Mjpresson on not being personally a cigarette smoker; neither were Nixon and Reagan who pursued the war against cannabis alias """"drugs"""" to benefit the cigarette industry; how does Mj administer hash without a one-hitter or a vaporizer?

Time running out on the anonymous Public Liebrewery computer forced me to stop 40 minutes ago, therefore the """"unsigned"""" incomplete message; to continue:

My conjecture (which I will be so bold as to share with you here) is that Mj's agenda includes:

 Using Wikipedia to promote the interests of the cigarette industry (through his advocacy in 44 detailed articles about the chain-smoking movie-maker José Mojica Marins whose main character Ze do Caixão (in English """"Coffin Joe"""" sound like Joe Camel?) commits serial murders for sex and personal vindication).  I personally couldn't smoke enough tobacco to stay awake sitting through 88 hours of those horror flicks.  To reference another BRIC country: a 2004-05 study showed 89% of all movies made in India contained depictions of """"tobacco use"""" (almost always cigarettes).

 Trying to remove from Wikipedia cannabis-related articles any information about possible Harm Reduction alternatives to hot burning overdose """"joint"""" smoking such as one-hitters, kiseru, midwakh etc. """"joint"""" and rolling papers are a handy Industry strategy to get children oriented to cigarette smoking.

 Trying to delete information that could serve as a warning against mixing cannabis with tobacco (for example, an edit deleting a reference in the hashish article to an Australian Department of Health study indicating that that practice could lead to unintended nicotine addiction (which is of course what cigarette companies want it to do).

This may explain why, in May 2010, Mjpresson nominated the One-hitter (smoking) article for deletion (reason: """"It's just a bad article."""") (vote: 4-1 for Keep).  By October 2010, after pictures of midwakh, kiseru etc. were added, the article ranked ninth in Category:Cannabis smoking with 1191 hits a day according to a rating survey.  This week, expecting to win the vote against Tokerdesigner at ANI, Mjpresson has deleted over 50% of the One-hitter (smoking) article, including pictures (all-important!) showing what a one-hitter is.

At ANI I have referenced the May 30, 2011 World Health Organization press release claiming that """"tobacco"""" (mainly cigarette smoking of course) will kill 6 million human beings in 2011, and scheduled to rise at present rates to 8 million a year by 2030; so if Mjpresson says Tokerdesigner is a """"single-purpose editor"""" at least you'll understand why.

So again, congratulations for opposing putting a picture of a """"joint"""" atop the [[Cannabis (smoking) article (especially without any warning that there may be tobacco mixed into it), but beware, you have doubtless attracted """"their"""" attention and Big 2WackGo may be after you.

 Note: beware of 3-R's, i.e. by simply reverting mJ'S edit three times you may violate a WP rule aimed at preventing edit wars; better strategy is to change something, add something different with each edit, trying to improve things each time in the interest of a positive solution.  Mj is a stickler for following the rules and will get you for that.  Though I consider him a stooge of the world's leading genocide-for-profit conspiracy I also recognize that Mj is talented and industrious and may do much good someday (after being """"forgiven on grounds of insanity"""").

 Try to find more pictures (make a JPG file and upload to Wiki Commons, I don't have that technology yet) which show better what a one-hitter is (quarter-inch or 6-mm screened crater for 25-mg single servings, instead of 500 mg in a joint every time you want a smoke! avoiding heat shock and carbon monoxide and dopy """"stoner"""" symptoms blamed on cannabis etc.)  Mj objects to the midwakh picture because it is traditionally used for tobacco, not cannabis, but he also deleted it from the one-hitter article where it was clearly described as used for tobacco.  The kiseru picture is a bit indistinct and doesn't show how narrow the crater is.  The major fear of the tobacco industry, even more than cannabis legalization, is the de facto legalization of harm reduction utensils which eliminate the need for high-profit cigarette papers.

Perhaps this massacre should be mentioned in the history section, as it is 1) a particularly dramatic episode in Israeli history, and 2) the event that triggered Menachem Begin's frightening quote """"As at Deir Yassin, so everywhere"""". It would also help lend credibility to this article, which, as another user pointed out, is basically a pro-Israeli sales-pitch that glazes over descriptions of injustices in favour of terminology that distances itself from real events. Not that the Palestinians haven't committed their fair share of atrocities, either, but healthy representations of both groups' histories would be nice.

Not to bate charges of anti-semitism (or make conjectural accusations), but there is a problem with pages like this on Wikipedia, too (including Americans), as the Jewish population is inevitably better-represented than groups that don't per capita possess so many of the characteristic prescribed by Wikipedia as being typical of its user base, including higher income levels, literacy, access to technology, etc. These conditions, unfortunately, are condusive to incidents of systemic bias - how many Palestinians are frequent Wikipedians? Moreover, many Jews are highly politicized (though diversely), and very culturally involved, which suggests it's possible that systemically biased political and cultural views could be adversely effecting Wikipedia's objectivity.

 File:Romantic Warriors cover.jpg 

You've tagged File:Romantic Warriors cover.jpg for deletion because it is not being used on an article. However it is being used in a draft article - I was under the impression that we allowed such use. It seems a little unfair to blame the draft creator when it is our own AfC that is backlogged.  (talk) 
 Non-free files may only be used in the article namespace. The draft author should not upload non-free images until the image can be used in the article namespace. See WP:NFCC#9.   

Fair enough, that makes sense. I've sent an email asking the copyright holder if they will license the image. Cheers.  (talk) 

 File:Drexel social primary blue full.png 

It appears that you've tagged File:Drexel social primary blue full.png for deletion because it's not being used in an article. However, on the file's page, it states that it is currently being used in the article Drexel University, and I've also verified that is the case.   
 Actually, if you look at the """"file usage"""" section on the file information page, it says that the image isn't used anywhere. However, this statement doesn't look correct...   
 Interesting, the same thing appears to be happening for another logo on the page that wasn't uploaded by me. I wonder if there's some sort of bug. In the meantime, do you know if there's a way to remove the deletion request, or at least ensure that the logos will not be removed as scheduled?  
 Go to Special:ApiSandbox and select """"purge"""" in the """"Action"""" drop-down box. Tick the """"forcelinkupdate"""" checkbox. In the field """"titles"""", fill in the name(s) of all article(s) using the file, separated by . After that, click on """"Make request"""". The """"file usage"""" section should now show the image as being used in the articles again. After that, you may remove the deletion tag.   
Thanks! This has been resolved for both this image and from Drexel seal.png and the deletion tag has been removed from both.   

File:Veterans Of Foreign Wars Logo.jpg

This file is now used in the Veterans of Foreign Wars article. Thanks for the heads up or orphan status. I think this is a better image than the emblem that was in the VFW article, but I've been wrong before.   

 Be careful where you place comments 

Stefan2, please be careful you do not place comments on user pages but on user talk pages. You placed several comments on my user page which I was not happy about.  
 The page User talk:Singingdaisies is a redirect to the page , which places the notification on the redirect target if the user talk page is a redirect, and in this case the redirect target was a user page. There are currently five user talk pages which are redirects to your user page. You might wish to change those. I see that plenty of different users have left notices on your user page, presumably related to those five accounts whose talk pages redirect to your user page.

That's an interesting point actually. I'm not totally sure of the answers, but what I do know is that yes the dip can get sequestered into the fat in the wool of the animals, as farmers are advised to wash carefully after handling newly-dipped sheep for a few days afterwards. However, after a few days that risk is known to be diminished so presumably it moves back out of the wool and is washed away by rain, general rough and tumble. 

Another thing is that the type of thing organophosphates give rise to in humans are neurological... fatigue, dizziness... possibly it does have some effects on the sheep, but it would be difficult to tell. 

The sheep aren't prevented from ingesting it, but the design of sheep dipping baths is such that there isn't a great opportunity for ingesting the dip. They are only totally immersed for about 2 seconds. There's a bar below head level that they need to duck under to move on and out of the bath. 

All products granted a Veterinary Product Authorisation (that's what they're called in Ireland, there are similar in other countries), and intended for use in food animals, , have a specific withdrawal period worked out for them, which makes up part of the regulatory submission during the drug's development, and is printed on the container. There is one for milk and one for meat products. This takes the form of a statement """"For the duration of treatment and X days afterward, products from this animal must not enter the human food chain"""" or """"This animal must not be slaughtered for human consumption for a minimum of X days after the date of the last treatment"""".

After all the times you have thwarted me... After all the times my plans for world domination were foiled by your meddlesome interference... After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

Very clever, Creutzfeldt, though to first hold forth with strong opinions on something you quite evidently knew absolutely nothing about, and then, after a cursory skim, to blather your opinions for a lot longer, seems out of character for a supposed expert in """"mathematical logic"""" (a claim of yours I find very dubious), not to mention someone trained by """"the Jesuits"""" (I hope you're seeing a counselor).

Dear Non Curat Lex

According to Wikipedia """" The criterion for validity of a legal rule in such a society is that it bears the warrant of the sovereign and will be enforced by the sovereign power and its agents."""" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_positivism

You are using the term """"legal rule"""" to describe """"Laws and organizations charged with regulating judicial conduct may also impact pro se litigants. For example, The State of California Judicial Counsel has, through published materials addressed the need of the Judiciary to act in the interests of fairness to self-represented litigants. [5] The California rules express a preference for resolution of every case on the merits, even if it requires excusing inadvertance by a pro se litigant that would otherwise result in a dismissal. (While this creates double standardyour unsupported unflagged statement), The Judicial Counsel justifies it based on the idea that """"Judges are charged with ascertaining the truth, not just playing referree... A lawsuit is not a game, where the party with the cleverest lawyer prevails regardless of the merits.""""[6] It suggests """"the court should take whatever measures may be reasonable and necessary to insure a fair trial"""" and says """"There is only one reported case in the U.S. finding a judge's specific accommodations have gone too far"""".

Do you mean that """"the court should take whatever measures may be reasonable and necessary to insure a fair trial"""" """"will be enforced by the sovereign power and its agents.""""?

Why are you describing my insertion of the following 13 citations as """"controversial edits"""" and what difference does it make that it is controversial? Wikipedia is supposed to be able to deal with controversial subjects such as presidential elections.  Did you find the references to be inaccurate?  Why exactly did you delete the following?

""""The wording """" which requires a judge to “accord to every person who has a legal interest in a proceeding . . . the right to be heard according to law.” is used in many state codes including Alabama,  Canon III a 4 http://www.alalinc.net/jic/docs/cans2006.pdf  Idaho, Canon III a 7http://www.judicialcouncil.idaho.gov/code.pdf  Indiana, Canon III b 8http://www.in.gov/judiciary/rules/jud_conduct/index.html   Kentucky,  Canon III a 7 SCR 4.300http://www.sunethics.com/kycodejudconduct.htm  New Jersey,Canon III a 6 http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/rules/appendices/app1_jud.htm#P29_2525, NevadaCanon III b 7 http://www.leg.state.nv.us/CourtRules/SCR_CJC.html Wisconsin  SCR 60.4 g http://www.wicourts.gov/sc/rules/chap60.pdf.Pennyslvania,  Canon III a (4) http://www.pacode.com/secure/data/207/chapter33/chap33toc.html Virgina,  Canon III a 7http://www.courts.state.va.us/jirc/canons_112398.html#canon3  Rhode Island,  Canon III a 7 http://www.courts.state.ri.us/supreme/jtd/code.pdf  Washington State,Canon III a 4 http://www.cjc.state.wa.us/Gov_provision/code_canons.htm' West VirginiaCanon III a 7 http://www.state.wv.us/wvsca/JIC/Codejc.htmUtah,  Canon III b 8http://www.law.uh.edu/Libraries/ethics/Judicial/judiccanons/canon3.html 

Why did you insert the qualifier """"while this creates a double standard"""" and not flag it?  My understanding is that all a court will do is make sure the rules are understood.  As clear in the reference, if a complaint should be dismissed because of statute of limitations, for instance, there is no difference between the results based on whether it is filed by a lawyer or not.

I see no Wikipedia justification for your choice to delete the state judicial canons, even if Risker and Arthur Ruben also want them deleted.

By saying that the state judicial canons are """"controversial edits"""" you are admitting that they are """"relevant"""".

If Cochrane makes conclusions specifically about chiropractic, then we should feel free to use it as a source (regardless of whether the conclusions are positive or negative for chiropractic). However, we should not include Cochrane reviews which are only making conclusions about spinal manipulation in general (not specifically about chiropractic). Such reviews are best suited for the Spinal manipulation article.

 I am in the process of creating a detailed but clear RfC to address this matter in general, but if the editors here can generally agree to the proposal Eubulides describes here as: """"to remove citations to sources 'using research which does not make any conclusions about chiropractic specifically'"""", then I see no need to open the RfC can of worms.   discuss """,0,0

Candid Camera: Australian Photography 1950s–1970s was a group retrospective exhibition of social documentary photography held at the Art Gallery of South Australia from 28 May to 1 August 2010.Art Gallery of South Australia Exhibitions Candid Camera website

Candid Camera had its roots in Six Photographers, a groundbreaking exhibition held in Sydney in May 1955, which concentrated on what was still a relatively new development in Australian photography and featured the work of Max Dupain, David Potts, Axel Poignant, Gordon Andrews, Kerry Dundas and Hal Missingham.Robinson, Julie """"Candid Camera: Australian Photography 1950s–1970s"""" Art Gallery of South Australia exhibition catalogMcDonald, Patrick """"The Way We Were"""" The Advertiser, 20 May 2010 AdelaideNow websiteNewton, Gael """"Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988"""" Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055) The work of the first three of these artists is also represented in Candid Camera. Six Photographers, an artist-initiated show that featured 200 images at a time when exhibitions of personal photographic work were rare, was regarded as sufficiently influential for the Art Gallery of New South Wales to commemorate it with a show of the same name featuring the same six photographers, more than 50 years after it had first been presented.Newton, Gael """"Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988"""" Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055)Newton, Gael """"Silver And Grey: Fifty Years Of Australian Photography 1900-1950"""" Angus & Robertson, 1980 (ISBN 0207141096)Art Gallery of New South Wales Exhibitions Archive AGNSW websiteAllen, Christopher """"Decisive Moments"""", The Australian, 27 February 2010 The Australian website This second version of Six Photographers featured 29 images, many of them shown in 1955, and concentrated on works from the same period (the late forties through to the mid-fifties).

Candid Camera, while about half the size of the 1955 Sydney exhibition, covered a significantly wider range of artists and looks not just at the foundations of Australian social documentary photography but at the era that curator Julie Robinson clearly regards as its golden age – the fifties, sixties and seventies.

In line with the statements issued by the six photographers group, Candid Camera featured “images which appear unposed, spontaneous, or with their subjects captured unaware”. Though the majority of the photos in the exhibition (more than 80 in total) were taken in Australia, images by Australian photographers working overseas were also included.Allen, Christopher """"Unguarded Moments"""", The Australian, 17 July 2010 The Australian websiteEmmett, Patrick """"Candid Camera"""" ABC Television interview, originally broadcast on Stateline, 28 May 2010 ABC website Subjects included youth subcultures, newly arrived migrants, nuns, a number of prime ministers (though not all were in office at the time of the photo), musicians such as Bon Scott of AC/DC, and ordinary people in everyday settings: at work, at the beach and at bus stops.

Photographers represented in Candid Camera included Max Dupain, David Moore, Jeff Carter, Max Pam, Robert McFarlane, Mervyn Bishop, Rennie Ellis, Carol Jerrems and Roger Scott and a number of others. Of those named, all have work held in the permanent collection of National Gallery Of Australia. Mervyn Bishop is the only Aboriginal Australian to have been included, and though his work has primarily been in New South Wales, Robert McFarlane was the only photographer to be born in South Australia. In this last regard, Candid Camera was very different to Century In Focus, an earlier large-scale photographic survey curated by Robinson, which dealt only with images taken in South Australia.Robinson,",0,0

Some of the sentences there seem copied directly from Dr Gerstenfeld’s homepage; this is not desirable, because it creates the impression that the article was copied from the homepage, which might be be a copyright violation. Perhaps you should try to rewrite the article a bit to avoid that. Also, some kind of indication about why Dr Gerstenfeld is notable would be nice to have (cf.

75ce74f1f2def295,"""taHindenburg, influenced by the Camarilla, became increasingly estranged from Brüning and pushed his Chancellor to move the government in a decidedly authoritarian and right-wing direction. This culminated, in May 1932, with the resignation of the Brüning cabinet.

Hindenburg appointed the nobleman Franz von Papen as Chancellor, heading a """"Cabinet of Barons"""". Papen was bent on authoritarian rule and, since in the Reichstag only the conservative German National People's Party (DNVP) supported his administration, he immediately called for new elections in July. In these elections, the Nazis achieved their biggest success yet and won 230 seats, becoming the largest party in the Reichstag.

Knowing that it was not possible to form a stable government without Nazi support, Papen tried to persuade Hitler to become Vice-Chancellor and enter a new government with a parliamentary basis. Hitler, however, would settle for nothing less than the chancellorship. He put further pressure on Papen by entertaining parallel negotiations with the Centre Party, Papen's former party, which was bent on bringing down the renegade Papen. In both negotiations, Hitler demanded that he, as leader of the strongest party, must be Chancellor, but Hindenburg consistently refused to appoint the """"Bohemian lance corporal"""" to the chancellorship.

After a vote of no-confidence in the Papen government, supported by 84% of the deputies, the new Reichstag was dissolved, and new elections were called in November. This time, the Nazis lost some seats but still remained the largest party in the Reichstag.

After Papen failed to secure a majority, he proposed to dissolve the parliament again along with an indefinite postponement of elections. Hindenburg at first accepted this, but after General Kurt von Schleicher and the military withdrew their support

Freestypefrappe, I will not stay calm until you stop vandalizing the Kumanovo page talking only about murdering, blood, terrorism and nothing about the city normal life. Of course, there were moments in the Kumanovo’s history when a terrorist attacks took place, but Kumanovo is most of the time a quiet ordinary Macedonian town that doesn’t deserve such descriptions.  It is the same as if you write an article about London not mentioning St Paul’s catedral, Westminster, Tower bridge.. and writing only about recent terrorist attacks in the London underground.

Hi ,
 Re 1 and 2: I don't have access to any additional facilities.  I am a run-of-the-mill editor like you, not an administrator.  Flagging suspected copyright violations is something any editor can do; it does not require administrator privileges.  The procedure for doing this is described on WP:CP.  It does take an administrator to delete a page, however, which is the usual result from suspected copyright violations.  The notice is posted on the article in question, and on the WP:CP page, nowhere else.  Again, I have no subscription to EB, nor any tools except search engines for detecting copyright violations.
 Re 3: If you scroll down WP:CP, you'll see it consists mainly of reports, with the occasional comment, many of which are not from the original poster.  Typically the original contributor does not respond at all within the seven day window.  There are many new contributors who happily copy-and-paste from other websites, with utter disregard of their copyright notices, and our policies.  Have a look at some of the listed items for examples.  Most entries on the WP:CP page are in dated sections under """"New listings"""", but some have """"fallen off the top"""" into """"Older than 7 days"""".  
 Re 4: If you look at the original report on WP:CP#July 11, you'll see that  listed that URL.  Presumably the same URL also appeared in the original copyright notice.  How that URL was found, I have no idea, but I would suspect search engines before spyware.  8-)  It's by a human comparison of that page with yours that I perceive a certain amount of similarity in phrasing and structure.  I'm prepared to accept that it's within the bounds of coincidence.
 Re 5: You are correct; permit me to clarify.  People often reproduce text from other websites citing permission with various constraints like """"in Wikipedia"""", """"for non-commercial purposes"""", """"providing it is quoted without alteration"""", or """"on condition that the source is credited in a particular way"""".  Unfortunately, none of those (except perhaps the last) is satisfactory for text in Wikipedia for the reasons I explained above.
 Re 6: New articles can be seen at Special:Newpages.  Changes to all articles can be seen at Special:Recentchanges.  Everyone has their own criteria for which entries they check, but most people are more suspicious of anonymous users than of logged in users.
 I note with regret that  has just blocked you for 24 hours.  In the same circumstances, were I an administrator, I would probably not have done this, but you have to admit that you did twist each other's tails quite a bit.  Perhaps this will give you a chance to concentrate on your other project.  8-) Note that you can still edit your user page, and I think you can still send e-mails using the """"E-mail this user"""" link.  I'll add a note to both entries on WP:CP that we are in a dialogue.
 This is probably an unnecessary remark, but I feel I should point out that if you edit Wikipedia from a different address and identify yourself to me, I will feel obliged to report it as block evasion.  This is independent of my feelings about the block itself.  Sorry.

Agreed. I amended the article after the chessbase article came out. I think it's only fair to report it, without endorsing or refuting the possibility that Topalov did, in fact, cheat. Dionyseus has never understood the difference between saying, """"Topalov was accused of cheating"""" and """"Topalov cheated"""", so it is possible that he will now delete my edit, arguing that Topalov didn't cheat. It's frustrating and time consuming, arguing with characters like that. And while I had plenty of passive support last year, I'd appreciate some more active support for inclusion this time around, should Dionyseus choose to make another big stink. Apparently, Dionyseus interprets neutrality as the censorship of negative information, no matter how factual. Of course, this is the same guy who, last year, edited Kramnik's article so that it started with a list of his match losses. Of course, I wouldn't want to infringe upon wiki's tradition of love, charity, and respect; so, I feel I should clarify my position insofar as I absolutely DO NOT regard Dionyseus to be 1) a blight on wikipedia, 2) a mental degenerate, 3) incapable of lucid reasoning, or 4) incapable of language use. He is certainly none of those things. And admins may take that as an official statement.  """,0,0

Yes, I forgot to address the amendment to include criticisms issue. Based on my reasoning concerning Clinton's statement, the criticisms are equally irrelevant and should not be included (in my humble opinion). To Mdiamante - I realize this is not Lexis. However, I think we can set a good precedent in the legal articles by refraining as much as possible from POV editing. I've always criticized Wikipedia based on its lack of reliability and blatant bias, but when I came across this article I thought """"Wow, maybe this is a topic I can help contribute to without all of the POV nonsense."""" Then, of course, I saw the Dred Scott section and thought """"shit."""" It's not so much that I don't think ANY cases or legal topics should include sections/statements from groups/individuals unconnected to the legal community. Indeed, it would be insane to make such a claim, given the almost-revolutionary impact of some cases - not just on society, but on legal thought. See, e.g., Roe (which, by the way, I was pleasantly surprised with). Rather, I just think some are not, and this happens to be one of them. Perhaps my opinion would be different if old Bill had supported his statement with some sort of reasoning, but he clearly did not. It was just a conclusory assertion; something my mother might say in a fit of anger. But alas, this is not a battle I'm going to wage. I will continue browsing legal articles when I get some time and decide if the POV is decidedly less prevalent than in other areas. If so, I'd love for Wikipedia to become a hobby.65.247.226.99  """,0,0

798a63effc639bd6,"""Blacks have extremely low visual memory so it is very difficult for them to recall digits in reverse.

Race and intelligence (explanations)#Spearman's hypothesis

IQ tests contain one or more sets of test questions of different varieties. Individually administered tests often are composed of subtests that have different homogeneous item contents. The mean Black-White difference varies considerably across tests with different contents. For example, the BW gap is larger on tests that require the recall of a series of digits in reverse order than on tests that require the recall of a series of digits in forward order. Across a large number of test, the standardized mean Black-White gap varies from near zero to over one standard deviation. According to , """"this variation between tests in the size of the standardized mean W-B difference is not explainable in terms of test bias or in terms of differences in types of item content or other formal or superficial characteristics of the tests.""""

""""The g-based factor hierarchy is the most widely accepted current view of the structure of abilities"""" Correlations between an IQ subtest's g-loading, and the magnitude of the Black-White-East Asian score gap for that subtest (;  pp. 47-8;  pp. 138-9).  For example, the Black-White gap is greater on backward digits span (a test where subjects repeat digits in the reverse order that they are given, and the more g-loaded test) than forward digits span (a test where subjects repeat digits in the same order that they are given, and the less g-loaded test).  As predicted by Spearman's hypothesis, the B-W gap is largest on the most g-loaded tests.  Narrowing of the B-W gap has been seen mostly on less g-loaded tests, such as literacy tests. Murray, C.  (2005) """"The Inequality Taboo"""".  Commentary Magazine, September 2005. Arthur Jensen argues that there is no independent evidence that the environmental explanations commonly given for the Black-White gap (for example, """"past history of slavery"""", discrimination, """"caste status"""", """"peer pressure against 'acting white'"""", etc) have an effect on g (, p. 510).
|The author of multiple factor analysis, L. L. Thurstone (1947), warned """"we must guard against the simple, but common, error of merely taking a first centroid factor, a first principal component, or other mean factor, in a test battery and then calling it a general factor"""".  """"Spearman's g, then, is a """"statistical artifact."""" (C. Loring Brace, 2001)

The gap is larger to recall digits in reverse because blacks are much lower in visual intelligence.

""""a test where subjects repeat digits in the reverse order that they are given, and the more g-loaded test""""

IQ tests are biased against blacks because they are designed to test people with high visualspatial intelligence.

This is obviously original research, but I cannot find no sources that supports my argument (even though I am not black).

I'm going to pretend for just a moment, Fred, that you'd actually be interested in my advice. Please don't feel any need to insult me over this  I don't have any real belief that your interested in anything I have to say.

But anyway, in this imaginary world where you actually are interested in my advice, I would tell you that, in the capacity of an arbitrator, you've written a summary of the focus of the dispute that (a) includes an alleged statement of the opinion of one party to the dispute that that party has denied, and that (b) the other side of the dispute seems to think is inaccurate. Again in this imaginary world, I would suggest to you that maybe it would be more productive to re-write the damn summary that no one likes rather than, say, to write a new article about Wikilawyering.

Back to this world, now. I'm going to spend a day or so trying to get El C to write the second notice to you, just because I think it would be good for him to do it. I don't think he will, but I noted to you that I wouldn't start looking for someone to write the second notice to you for a day or two, so I'll spend that time """"mentoring"""" El C before I seriously start looking.

In fairness, I think I should tell you that, while I do think you are absolutely wrong in this particular matter, and I really will pursue it to the very end, I find your attitude pretty amusing, and it is entertaining for me (in some dark way, perhaps) to see the innovative and gymnastic things you come up with in order to avoid doing what seems to me to be quite obviously the right thing to do. I'm telling you this because possibly you find the whole thing very annoying and draining  as indeed I would, if I were continually having to make up new reasons for not doing what is obviously the right thing to do  and if that's the case, this could be a bad situation for you: you're drained while I'm entertained. Now, probably some worthy will turn my words here against me, and claim (ignoring my clear statement that I think you are absolutely wrong in this particular matter) that I am just trying to be annoying to you. But I can deal with that, and it really is as a favor to you that I've informed you that I think this whole process is amusing to me.

Good point  how does the title relate to the meaning of apartheid? This was discussed somewhat in the centralized Talk and the synthesis. There are two meanings of apartheid: (1st) The official self-described policy of South Africa. (2nd) Similar or analogous policies in other places. The title """"Israeli apartheid"""" uses the 2nd meaning. This seems to favor the anti-Israel side. In the suggestion that started this thread  """"Comparisons between Israel and apartheid-era South Africa"""" the word 'apartheid' has the 1st meaning. This arguably favors the pro-Israel side. But """"Israel and apartheid""""?? Gee, one of the interesting things about """"Israel and apartheid"""" is that the noun 'apartheid' is not modified (either by Israeli or SA). So here the meaning of 'apartheid' is ambiguous. If you don't mind my asking a follow-up question, Andyvphil, don't you think that ambiguity might add to the appeal of such a title?  | Talk """,0,0

All these MBT's including the Merkava, can fit aboard the C-5 Galaxy and C-17 Globemaster air transports to be airlifted anywhere on the globe. The Merkava Mk 4 has a 1500hp GD833 Diesel Engine and additional armor, especially up top, for urban battlefields. Ever been to the Holy land? You get all types of terrain there, not the stereotypical desert/arabian landscape that is always seen on TV. There are forests and swamps in Israel, and up north the terrain is especially rough and it snows too. What consensus are you talking about? Israel has had more battlefield experience with the use of armor and armored warfare in general than any country on this planet. The weight of the Merkava Mk 4 is approximately the same as the M1A2SEP. It has more crew protection than the Leopard tank and has an active self-defense system. It also retains the 60mm Mortar which can be fired under armor. BATTLEFILED MOBILITY of the Merkava series of tanks is better than both the M1 and the Leopard. It is true that both tanks are faster than the Merkava but the Merkava was designed with emphasis on crew protection, survivability and firepower, over speed. The Merkava is more survivable in a firepower-saturated environment meaning it can go places the M1 and Leopard cannot. For this reason the Merkava has more freedom to maneuver, which gives more options to it's operators and commanders, and allows more aggressive courses of action. The enemy cannot simply deny areas to the Merkavas by firepower, meaning the Israeli tank has better battlefield mobility than the Abrams and Leo 2.",0,0

 Controversial Cupboard 

I have very little time left now for major work here so I propose making a subsection of this, my talk page, since it's getting a teency weency bit long now. (171 kilobytes)

The first cupboard will be entitled """"Irish Terrorism/Politics"""" and I propose moving whole sections of my talk page into it - if there are no vehement and persuasive objections. I'll keep the same chronological order, but these are the sections I plan on moving in their entirety:- 
    * 7 Stop canvassing!
    * 8 Gaimhreadhan
    * 9 Sockpuppetry block
    * 10 Unblocked
    * 17 Result of PIRA investigation
    * 20 Jean McConville
    * 21 You have been blocked
    * 28 Trim
    * 29 User talk:Tyrenius
    * 38 Blocked
    * 39 Gaimhreadhan's Block
    * 40 Your post on my talk page
    * 41 Legal threat
    * 46 Block
          o 46.1 Infallibility
    * 48 Block reduced

I estimate that this """"housekeeping""""/censorship will reduce this page's size by more than 65% and make it more manageable for those of readers who use dial up modems and/or are moaning.

I realise that some of these sections are not wholly concerned with """"Irish Terrorism/Politics"""" but all have comments that could be categorised as such and I did not wish to separate comment and riposte, in so far as that is practically possible....Gaimhreadhan (kiwiexile at DMOZ) talk  • """,0,0

 Luis Miguel Gallego Basteri 

I would consider your move from Luis Miguel to Luis Miguel Gallego Basteri as a highly controversial renaming of an article. Please do not take offense, but I am positive that you are not familiar with this topic, or Spanish culture in general. Here are my thoughts on this:

 Luis Miguel is a singer of worldwide fame and much more notable than the other four Luis Miguels that you included in that disambiguation list.
 Luis Miguel is much more of a public figure than any other Luis Miguel, since he is a Grammy winner and is often romantically associated with big stars, such as Mariah Carey, Daisy Fuentes, etc.
 Please also note that """"Luis Miguel"""" is his professional name, and that is why he is notable, he is not a scientist or politician or any other profession where a full name is used. 
 Also only one of the other Luis Miguels has an article, therefore people looking for """"Luis Miguel"""" will be taken to that disambig page while almost all of them will be looking for the singer and not anybody else. 
 In addition, none of the other Luis Miguels go by """"Luis Miguel"""" only the singer. 

I will strongly suggest you moved the page back to Luis Miguel and create another Luis Miguel (disambiguation) page.

 The problem that deeply concerns me is the fact that fox news attempts to claim neutrality when their own newspaper, the New York Post, claims that they are conservative.

 Ongoing IAU discussion? 

Is the reason that there was no improved IAU definition of planets that they wanted to pass such a decision with a large majority, but couldn't come to an agreement yet? I hope it's not that they think the current definitions are OK, because they're clearly not. For example the definition of extrasolar planet states the lower mass limit for an object to be an extrasolar planet is the same as in the Solar System... but there was no such limit given. Neither for dwarf planets nor for regular planets. There would have been no harm done if the upper limit for extrasolar planets was also applied to the Solar System, but that wasn't done either. It's like they're hiding everything behind smoke and mirrors and make up the results as they go.

It would be relatively easy to come up with criteria that could decide if a newly discovered body is a planet or not. But they didn't do it. Why? What for example is wrong with the following?
1. A planetary mass object is an object with a mass between the agreed mass limit needed for hydrostatic equilibrium (5×1020kg) and the agreed mass limit needed for deuterium fusion (2.5×1028kg). (Both limits might be set lower since the first would exclude Pallas and Vesta which are remaining protoplanets and the second doesn't take into account that objects with high metallicity could allow deuterium fusion at a lower mass)
2. A planet is a planetary mass object on an orbit around at least one star that also has the capability of clearing its orbit (per Stern-Levison criteria. The difference is you only need to know mass and orbital period of the object (and the star of course), whereas with Soter's criteria you'd need to know everything about the system).
3. A dwarf planet (I prefer mesoplanet) is a planetary mass object on an orbit around at least one star that doesn't fulfill the Stern-Levison criteria.

More definitions could be added to account for other types of planetary mass objects. I prefer """"planetar"""" for those that don't orbit any star - regardless if they were formed by themselves or in a system of which they were later ejected. Also, I'd like """"moon"""" to mean a planetary mass object that orbits a planet (since the prototype object Luna is just that) - smaller bodies would just keep being """"satellites"""". (If you don't like to have 60 planets of which most are small, why would you allow 60 moons of which most are tiny?)

Any ideas why the IAU doesn't come up with something like that?   

First of all, there is a lower mass limit: hydrostatic equilibrium. Second, this has nothing to do with improving the article. Simply talking about the merits or lack thereof of the IAU's decision is outside the scope of Wikipedia. podous 
Your second point is right. My opinions are not relevant, as I'm not an astronomer, and my conclusions from the available data would be OR, so neither belongs in the article. But you don't seem to realize that your first point is extremely open to definition. It could mean the shape of the object. Then the next question is where the limit between spheroidal and irregular is. It could mean an object with this mass and composition would certainly reach hydrostatic equilibrium. Or it could mean an object with this mass would certainly reach hydrostatic equilibrium. I'm heavily in favour of the third, as it is the one that could be most easily checked (especially for exoplanets), and avoids the problem that an ice world could qualify, while a larger and denser asteroid would be rejected, since rocky worlds are much harder to pull into equilibrium. But from statements in the article, I'm guessing at least those astronomers favor the second one. (And if they're not representative, why would they be in the article?)Basically, I want to say that the IAU should make a decision that makes it clear the astronomers know what they are doing and want to share their knowledge with the public. Because if the public decides to not follow astronomers' findings anymore, the result will likely be even less funding... and that would be a real problem.    
There are many ambiguities with the current definition, all of which are mentioned in the article already. podous 13:29, 19 Januar",0,0

 Is Agoda.com one of the largest travel sites in the world? 

According to what Asheshong had written """"Agoda.com is reported to be one of the largest and most popular online travel sites in the world"""".

However, when I read through the supporting ref 2,3,4 and 5, there was no mention of Agoda.com to be """"one of the largest in the world"""". Can anyone who is reasonable and logical, draw that conclusion?

Space disposal
I've been on a rampage today, looking for stuff that needs to be completely redone. So I rewrote the section on space disposal. It no longer contains any speculation on the feasibility of space disposal using technology that hasn't been created yet. More importantly, it now refers to a reliable source. I hope I haven't hurt anyone's feelings but it really needed to go.   
Thanks. These are people who nearly had seizures when we launched Cassini at Saturn with a few kg of Pu-238 in it. Even if we had a magical propulsion system for launching actinides into space for free, I doubt that politically people would tolerate the booster failure risk rate. If 1% of these things are going to fail and go into the ocean, why not just include the other 99% as well, while we're at it? ;). At least if you pick your spot, you can drop casks into ocean crustal subduction zones (which has been suggested).  

 """"A number of incidents"""" 

""""A number of incidents have occurred when radioactive material was disposed of improperly, simply abandoned or even stolen from a waste store.""""  This comes from near the end of the article, and I think it needs a """"citation needed flag.""""  Not only could people get uptight about this because it doesn't sound entirely neutral, I'd like to read about these incidents.

I think the possibility of a corrupt core of admins is a problem worth asking candidates on. So if anybody else posted this exact question there wouldn't be a problem with it? Particularly, I imagine, if it were a well respected admin with an impeccable record positing it?

I read each of the candidates statements, and used that to judge if this question would be useful, look at the time between asking the candidates questions. Also look at the """"ignore all evidence"""" question, this occurred to me as I was going along and it must be regarded as a general behavioural question when linked to the """"5 days"""" question, plus this shows it was not a """"spam"""" question to all candidates, I did pay attention to their statements.

This is the question I posed to select candidates.
What general concerns do you think are raised by the 5 days of silence from the community's admins in this ANI? Are there any other general concerns which arise from the ANI?

Do these quotes;

ameliorate, add to or amplify concerns?

Do you agree with the substance of the Jehochman quotes?

If an essay WP:IGNORE ALL THE EVIDENCE were written, what concerns would be behind it, and what could be done about them?
If you can point me to another ANI where lies and deceit by two admins within an ANI were ignored by the other admins in attendance for somewhere close to 5 days, then I will ask exactly the same question of those select candidates, substituting this with that example. Would that be acceptable?

Have you seen such examples of systemic corruption before? Or is this the only one? Of course to answer that you would also have to answer; can you say in all honesty that you think Ruslik did not lie in this ANI? If you choose not to answer... is it because you believe it is the moral thing to do, or because of possible intimidation or repercussions on your good self?   """,0,0

 Commercial Variants of Rogue in Japan? 

In 1991, there is """"Fatal Labyrinth"""" (Genesis/Megadrive, 1991) which could be considered as the first commercial variants of Rogue (because it took a lot of ideas from rogue with some extra features) but it's not so good and successful.

""""Fushigi no Dungeon"""" series (starting from """"Torneko no Daibouken"""" in 1993) themself are the most successful titles in Japan and start the trend of Japanese console roguelike games.

Fushigi no Dungeon have much tighter game balance, so that the challenge level is just right. Some role playing games (such as Climax Landers and Evolution) have also imported some roguelike concepts (primarily the randomly generated dungeon), but honestly not to any satisfactory effect, since the randomly generated dungeon plays little significance if battles take part in a different environment (namely, the orthodox RPG combat engine). Without its effect on playability, a randomly generated dungeon would in fact feel featureless and boring.

How they can be the variants of rogue?
- Feature one class which is warrior-type or Jack-of-all-trades. Supernatural powers are rely on items.
- Simple stats.
- Dungeon theme is a lot like rogue.
- Item sets like Potion, Wand (or rod), and Scroll. """"Furai no Shiren"""" also add Pots which are work as containers or item manipulating tools.
- ETC.

8fd9b36b591dbb48,"Specific points of fact

There seem to be two issues of fact in question:

 Which instruments are correctly called ten-string guitars?
 How many resonances are missing from the six-string guitar?

Viktor maintains that the twelve-string guitar is also incorrectly named, which is the issue on which we first crossed swords. I did not at first understand why it was so important to him, but later I discovered that he believes and argues strongly that only Yepes-tuned instruments and some nineteenth-century harp guitars are correctly called ten-string guitars. Obviously, if a twelve-string guitar is validly called that, then for example a baroque guitar might be called a ten-string guitar, and his chance of having non-Yepes-tuned instruments excluded as he wishes is remote. 

So far as Wikipedia is concerned, the main question is this: What should be the scope of the article at ten-string guitar? It seems to me that, under WP:NC, it certainly includes instruments that are built and sold by Ramirez and Bernabe to identical specification to the ones that they built for Yepes, but fitted with a different 7th string (only) to accomodate a different tuning. In fact I would also include any other guitar called a ten-string by its maker, such as the B.C.Rich Bich 10. And if we include that, then where do we draw the line? Wherever that might be, it won't be where Viktor wants it I'm afraid.

So far as resonances go, Viktor has raised this in many other forums. In the ten-string guitar Yahoo! group he was recently asked to list the resonances of the six-string guitar, to clarify what he meant by a similar essay to the one above. He listed nineteen of them!

The point is simply, resonance in this context is not well enough defined to enable us to count them and arrive at a unique answer. Whether we describe the eight missing notes (pitch classes), supplied by four resonant strings, as four resonances or as eight is academic.

Marlow may well be wrong on many other things. We all make mistakes! But this particular issue is a non-issue. Viktor's real problem with Marlow is simply that she is popularising a set of tunings for the Yepes guitar which he does not like.",0,0

 Camille Paglia: sex-positive feminist 

Here are the supporting links you asked for, you stupid twit!

http://www.lotl.com/content/paglia.htm

http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Sex-positive_feminism

If you are too lazy and full of yourself to read them in their entirety then I will just post the relevant sections here:

Camille Paglia: """"On the other hand I’ve been saying in public for five years ago, as someone who’s endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sex-positive experience, that I’m concerned about the effect on young people – people growing up from 8, 10, 14 in a climate where it’s gone to the opposite direction. I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism."""" 

Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of """"traditional"""" values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a """"respectable"""" face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large.""",1,0

On September 19, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov vowed to work for the release of the medics on his trip to Libya in November. novinite. U.S. President George W. Bush has said """"I want them free."""" One of Gaddafi's sons has admitted at least some Libyan responsibility. On December 24, 2005, it was announced that Libya, Bulgaria, the EU, and the US had agreed on a fund which may help to resolve the matter. Reuters. Yahoo!

In response to the risk of a new death penalty verdict in the current trial, international opinion has again began to mobilize. In October 2006, several scientific organizations responded with appeals, and The New York Times NY Times. and the journal Nature Nature. published strong editorials calling for a fair trial.

Quid pro quo
Although he concurred with the guilty verdict, Gaddafi proposed releasing the six medics, if quid pro quo:
the convicted Pan Am Flight 103 bomber Megrahi, serving a life sentence in a Scottish jail, were to be released; and
US$2.7 billion compensation were paid to Libya for the care of the HIV-infected patients (the exact sum offered by Libya in compensation for the 270 lives lost in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing).http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=57381
Bulgaria refused to pay any compensation on the grounds that it would be admitting the guilt of the medics. On June 7, 2005, the European Union engaged in negotiations to provide assistance to Libya, but not directly linked to the case of the six medics.http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=57040 On August 18, 2005, Libya recommended that Bulgaria should negotiate on the amount of the payment.http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory?id=1048104&CMP;=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 The next week, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) delegate visited Libya and saw the medics.http://www.novinite.com/newsletter/print.php?id=51534 On August 31, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin stated that Bulgaria would send humanitarian aid while not acknowledging the guilt of the medics.http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?catid=72&ch;=0&newsid;=71374http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?idCategory=33&idsub;=124&id;=1823 On September 8, it was announced that Libya had prepared a list of 40 items (non-monetary) that should be sent as aid and that Bulgaria could supply 24 of them.http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?focus=hot&hotid;=758

President Parvanov added: """"The unfair death sentences were reversed. …We hope that the swiftness and the effectiveness demonstrated by the Libyan court in the past days will help solve the case as soon as possible.""""

US State Department spokesman, Justin Higgins, described the decision as a """"positive development since it removes the risk of the death penalty being carried out. As we have made clear before, we believe a way should be found to allow the medics to return to their home"""".

Hi Playnine9

I forgot that we have stubs for everything, everyone, and their mother, including """"Ireland-related stubs.""""
well its better than having a couple of hundred thousand stubs in one category ) no problem with changing it (BTW most countries have their own geo-stub for places, almost all just CountryName-geo-stub).  - kiss the lizard 
Essex, Vermont as a City
Hi, thanks for your note. As I understand it its a municiple, political difference. City status doesn't automaticly come with size. This is clearer in the UK where there has to be a cathedral, a university and other factors (such as population size), then the Queen grants """"city"""" status. Here in the US I think its a little less rigorous, but the State grants the city """"status"""" if the town and state desire. I'm not sure what that status brings with it, but its likely to change the way the place is administered / financed and governed. I hope this helps  

According to the Vermont Citizens' Guide, (published by the Vermont League of Women Voters), """"The usual connotation of a city as a densely populated urban area is alien to Vermont.  Of the thirty largest local government units, only eight hold city charters and one must continue down the list to the 72nd largest community before reaching the ninth City of Vergennes with a population of 2,741 ... It is the form of government, not population, which distinguishes Vermont cities from towns.""""  Thus, it seems that something in Vermont is a city if and only if it has a city charter.

d6d60d32c6498df9,"""== Lenin in England ==

Following Lenin's death many streets in the strongly socialist (communist?) mining villages in the North East of England were changed to the names of Lenin and other communist leaders. See: http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl;=en&q;=DH9+6PA&om;=1 or Chopwell. Is this worthy of a mention in this article?

I think that is very interesting, and worth mentioning, especially since England is a western country.  

I agree. It is interesting that those actions were taken. It would be interesting to include the question of why.

 errata note 
The main article refers to a decision to execute the Tsar and family in August 1918. They were executed purportedly in Yekaterinburg the night of July 17-18 1918   the date of the discussion in the main article is in error (or is an old calendar form reference).

 Deleted material
""""Historical research, especially after the fall of Communism opened the Communist achieves, has shown many negative aspects of Lenin's regime. From the Black Book of Communism (Using the Julian calender): The October revolution was on October 25. The Communists started closing down independent newspaper and radio stations the day after (p. 54). On November 13, on order was sent out that all who were suspected being an """"enemy of the people"""" should be imprisoned (p. 55). Starting in January 1918, war prisoners were being tortured and killed on a large scale (p. 60-61). Starting in May, food was being """"requisitioned"""" from the peasants (p. 66). Also in May, several working-class demonstrations were bloodily suppressed (p. 68). There were around 110 peasants uprisings in July and August (p. 67). In June 1918, the Cheka already had 12,000 members (p. 68).  On the 9 and 10 of August, Lenin sent out telegrams ordering mass executions, deportations, and concentration camps. (p. 72-73). Trotsky also supported starting concentration camps (p. 63). 

After the assassination attempt on Lenin and the succesful assassination of Cheka leader Moisei Uritsky on the same day, Lenin and the other Bolshevik leaders decided to respond with overwhelming force, both as retribution and as a deterrent for any similar future attempts. This led to the particularly intensive period of oppression called the Red Terror.

In May 1919, there were 16,000 people in labor camp based on the old Tsarist katorga labor camps, in September 1921 there were more than 70,000 (p. 80). There were large scale rapes of """"bourgeoisie women"""" documented in 1920 (p. 105). In total, 50,000-200,000 summary executions of """"class enemies"""" occurred during Lenin regime.

During Russian Civil War, Lenin started """"requisitioning"""" supplies  from the peasantry for little or nothing in exchange. This led peasants to drastically reduce their crop production. In retaliation,  Lenin ordered the seizure of the food peasants had grown for their own subsistence and their seed grain. The Cheka and the army  began by shooting hostages, and ended by waging a second full-scale civil war against the peasantry. The food requisitioning are documented on p. 97 and p 120-121. The war on the peasantry, including the use of poison gas, death camps, and deportations are documented on p. 92-97 and p. 116-118. In 1920 Lenin ordered increased emphasis on the food requisitioning from the peasantry, at the same time that the Cheka gave detailed reports about the large scale famine (p. 121). The long war and a drought in 1921 also contributed to the famine. Finally, Lenin allowed relief organizations to bring aid but later had most of the Russian members organizing the aid liquidated. Foreign relief organizations suspended aid when it was revealed that the Soviet Union preferred to sell food abroad in order to get hard currency rather than feed its starving people. Estimates on the deaths from this famine are between 3 and 10 million. For comparison, the worst crop failure of late tsarist Russia, in 1892, caused 375,000 to 400,000 deaths .""""

As can be seen, it is extremely well-referenced. However, the communist supporters seems to be extremely afraid to let other know of this and immediately revert all attempts to insert it.  

I have never heard of this before. I highly recommend that you consult with a historian before publishing anything you read off of the internet! Infact, from what I learned in Western Civ, the Red Army didn't kill peasants, but they did consume much of their food (soldiers eat first, civilians second), leading to peas",0,0

 It takes about 30-35 hours to recite the entire Qur'an, although the speed at which the qari' recites can make that time longer or shorter. It will tend to be on the higher end of that range if it is recited during tarawih prayer, which requires that the Sura Al-Fatiha be recited hundreds of times.

 With liberty and justice for all. 

In response to a claim that liberalism does not advocate equality.

The foundational documents of liberalism stress both freedom and equality.  """"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal...""""

We know those high ideals were expressed by a man who owned slaves, and that while we are much closer to true equality today, we still have a way to go.  Still, one of the two principles that unite liberals is the idea of equality, in the sense of equal rights.  The liberal movement has consistently been in that direction, with equality for Negros first, then for women, maybe someday for homosexuals.  

By equality, I mean equality before the law  obviously all men are not equal at birth, but the law should not favor those born with greater advantages.  Sometimes equality and freedom conflict.  My freedom to own slaves conflicts with the slave's equality under the law.  But more often the two ideals are complementary.  My equal rights give me the freedom to walk down the sidewalk without the law telling me I must step into the gutter to allow a better man to pass.

Well, thank you. We certainly agree on fundamental difficulty in communicating. I am able to hear what you have to say. I don't perceive you as a Great Evil in your idiom, or ill-intended (except perhaps on one point I'll go into later), and I can generally extend good faith when one is open to public discussion. Given the many confusions involved, I first need to know: 1. Are you now willing, as I am, to discuss the primary issues in detail in a consensus-building discussion subject to such WP:BRD principles as """"listen very carefully"""" and """"be ready to compromise""""?
If so, the first consensus I need is whether an article should exist on the topic of dramatically-concentrated short-period political fundraising. Your objections at AFD appear to me primarily as """"magnet for edit-warring"""" and """"WP:COATRACK"""" (you raise other concerns related to neologism, but they do not enter into the question as I've phrased it). These concerns both seem bad arguments per WP:RUBBISH because they are surmountable problems, and Wikipedians may not delete based on creator intent but on criteria like notability: we are expected to resolve edit wars and coatracks by DR, not deletion. 2. Given this, for what reasons if any would you oppose existence of an article on the topic of dramatically-concentrated short-period political fundraising? (If none, I would ask you to change your AFD entry at this point in good faith.)
The second consensus I need is how to disambiguate the search string """"moneybomb"""". Previously you advocated google bomb as the primary redirect. Independent of the previous paragraph, I would ask: 3. What is your specific justification that users entering the string """"moneybomb"""" would be interested primarily in a detailed description of search manipulation, with a mention of the fundraising form without further fundraising elaboration? (If none, please propose alternate disambiguation specifics.) This proposition, which your position amounts to, would imply there is greater connection of the string """"moneybomb"""" with search manipulation than with fundraising, which is an exceptional claim to me, requiring detailed explanation. I'm sure you recognize that both reliable sources on this point use the string """"money bombing"""" and significantly not """"moneybomb"""".
This must suffice to begin. Please reply to these details first before we build to other matters such as policies.   """,0,0

People today are much taller than they were a hundred years ago and have a larger brain size.  This change is solely due to better nutrition.  It has been shown in many studies the nutritional deficienciess can lower I.Q..  However, having a higher i.q. means that you can get better nutrition for your child and thus add even more i.q. points.  So africa's average I.Q. of around 70 is lower than it's potential as evidenced by american blacks who have an I.Q. of about 85.  However this is probably the upper limit as to what african blacks could achieve since there is significant white admixture in american black populations.  Studies of adopted children have shown that asian children tend to have I.Q.'s significantly greater than their adoptive parents (110)  while black children have I.Q.'s that are lower than their adoptive parents (90).

8209996c48eb1923,"No, I'm not a member of the Los Angeles County Sheriffs' Office.  I'm not a member of the Mormon Church, either. Yet I have the right to feel offended when someone says every single Mormon man is a misogynist who sees every woman as a baby - making machine.  I have the right to defend law enforcement officers against the charge that their hard work consists of gossip.  Maybe they never solved the Kupcinet case, but their hard work has made the world safer for you and me and our parents.  If I were defending an extremist like a Ku Klux Klan member, then I would understand you pointing out that I ain't in the Klan.  But sheriffs aren't extremists.  Some make mistakes and commit crimes, but they are highly regarded by crime victims who get the satisfaction of seeing their tormentors get locked up.

You point out that newspaper articles reporting Dr. Harold Kade's egregious mistakes, one of which put an innocent man in jail for five months, say nothing about Kupcinet, therefore they aren't relevant to her case.  If the articles said he was a careless driver who got off work one night and then crashed his car into a truck carrying tissue samples to another lab for analysis, thereby making that person's death a total mystery, then your point would be valid.  An accident that Dr. Kade might have caused when he wasn't on the timeclock tells us nothing about his competence while he was on the clock.  We know he was on the clock when he put an innocent man in jail for five months. We know he was on the timeclock when he screwed up another case that was unrelated to that unfortunate man.  Therefore his screwy actions while he was working are relevant to yet another mysterious death that he was supposed to solve but didn't (Kupcinet). At least he didn't solve it to the satisfaction of those gossip queens known as sheriffs.  If they didn't cut open her dead body, then they knew nothing, right?  The woman's father didn't see the autopsy, either, and he actually was considered a gossiper by some people, so to hell with him, too.  Right ?

With your cockeyed logic, I can add a comment Richard Nixon made about Robert Kennedy's alleged relationship with Marilyn Monroe to the articles about Kennedy and Monroe, and anyone who adds a few words about Nixon's dishonesty can get banned from Wikipedia for 48 hours.  Nixon did, in fact, make a brief comment about Kennedy-Monroe when he was interviewed for 60 Minutes in 1984, ten years after he resigned.  Video and audio of it exist, but I, for one, never will add it to Wikipedia.  If I did, Wildhartlivie would want a footnote citation that identifies the producer of the segment and what he ate for breakfast on the day it aired.  Someone else would remove it on the basis that as long as it had nothing to do with China, anything Nixon said about others' flaws was a lie. That's good enough for me, but you're just going to say Watergate was a separate entity that had nothing to do with Kennedy or Monroe, therefore Nixon could have said they were both transsexuals and that's legitimate. 

Let gullible kids who read Wikipedia know what that great man said about an emotionally fragile woman he never met.  Your logic is cockeyed.  Unlike Monroe, whose autopsy was performed by a relatively competent doctor named Noguchi, Karyn Kupcinet was permanently screwed up by a klutz. Deal with it.  If you keep banning his klutzines, maybe you can delete the entire article about Jack Kevorkian. How do you know your body will be treated fairly the next time you visit a medical doctor ?  You don't.  If you're dead you don't complain.  Deal with it. Life sucks. People screw up everywhere, even in a room full of fresh corpses.",0,0

f290884e72efefe6,"This is a follow-up criticism of Gwen Gale's improper deletion of the Alex Jones criticism section. I have tried to have this discussed in a responsible way on her Talk page but she has outrageously deleted all the critiques I have posted there. In my view, Gwen Gale's actions and judgement are seriously called into question by her conduct apparent in this thread and subsequent attempts to discuss it. I will post the text of the complaint I made below. If you agree that she has acted improperly, please respond saying so. Two people of this opinion (one other) are required before a Request for Comment on her actions can be made.

This is a complaint relating to the conduct of Administrator Gwen Gale with specific reference to her summary deletion of the section labelled “Criticism” in the Alex Jones Talk Show Host page on 15 March 2009.

Her most substantive comments relating to the summary deletion were as follows  
“single source cited says it's not clear what even happened”
I've removed it following WP:BLP and WP:WEIGHT, given the single cited source says it's not even clear what happened, it's nothing but a non-notable, second-hand anecdote about what may or may not have been a parking lot brawl. Gwen Gale (talk) 
The grounds (as you put it) are WP:BLP. Gwen Gale (talk)  

The complaint is based on five points 
1/ Gwen Gale failed to follow proper policy with regard to deleting biographical material on living persons, viz. discussing it beforehand. The section had existed for some time, had been discussed and commented on extensively, and had been edited by several persons. As far as I am aware, Gwen Gale had no prior involvement in the page or the section concerned. Certainly, I had never seen her name in any of the page history. Unless it constituted a grave breach of some other policy, which not even Gwen Gale has claimed, any possible deletion should have been discussed beforehand and not executed summarily. To quote the BLP policy  “Biographical material about a living individual that is not compliant with this policy should be improved and rectified; if this is not possible, then it should be removed.”
No complaint about the nature of the material was made beforehand; no opportunity for improvement or rectification was offered. 
2/ Having failed to discuss it properly beforehand, Gwen Gale also failed to discuss it properly afterwards. She made a few general remarks, using terms which, as will be discussed later, do not form part of any Wikipedia policy, viz. “single sourced, anecdotal”, and breezily referred those who wanted to discuss the matter with her to general Wikipedia policy documents, such as Biography of Living Persons or Verifiability. As will be shown in what follows the text did not violate either of these policy documents. Gwen Gale refused multiple specific requests to quote the exact passages of the Biography on Living Persons or Verifiability policies which she claimed had been violated. This refusal to properly discuss a summary deletion is against Wikipedia conduct guidelines and not acceptable behaviour in an Administator.
3/ Gwen Gale’s comments on the summary deletion reveal that she does not understand the core Wikipedia policy on reliable sources.
4/ Gwen Gale’s comments indicate that she does not understand the proper scope of Wikipedia’s policy on Verifiability.
5/ Gwen Gale’s comments reveal that she does not understand Wikipedia’s Biography on Living Persons policy. 
The only serious grounds on which deletion of the deleted text could be justified is Weight. This is not the ground on which Gwen Gale chose to defend it. She repeatedly cited BLP and V as the core defence of her actions, demonstrating that her judgement is massively flawed and that her administrative powers should be revoked. The core issue here is not the content. The core issue is Gwen Gale’s conduct and judgement. The Weight issue will, however, be discussed at the end.

Gwen Gale’s Misunderstanding of the Wikipedia’s Guidelines on Reliable Sourcing
It is clear that Gwen Gale does not understand Wikipedia’s policy on sourcing. In stating that the claims embodied in the deleted text were “anecdotal”, she is effectively second-guessing the judgement of the original reliable source, viz. The Austin Chronicle. She is implicitly expressing the view that the Austin Chronicle’s assembled journalists, editors, sub-editors and lawyers made an error in judgement in publishing the article in the first place. This is completely unacceptable and represents a FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN JUDGEMENT. It is in no way appropriate for Wikipedia editors to make their own subjective judgements about the editorial standards of highly reputable and professional publications. It is the equivalent of an editor disputing a reference to a professional academic journal on",0,0

 Robert Conrad 

Frank, I've reversed your deletion in the Robert Conrad entry for his friendship with mafia hitman/murderer Tony Spilotro.  You deleted because it was """"uncited"""".  All you had to do was go to Google and Google """" 'Robert Conrad' 'Spilotro' """" and it is the very first entry - in an interview he gave.  It's quite well known.  You didn't even bother to do even a minimum of research.  I notice this a lot in Wikipedia - people deleting things they know nothing about, on subjects they know nothing about, and not bothering to do any research.  For the record, I don't delete or even modify anything if I do not know the subject matter quite well.  I don't know why you edited this out - you obviously know very little about Robert Conrad.  Anyway, I've put it back in, with the very first link I found, which was the very first entry that comes up on Google when you put in both their names.  Duh.""",0,0

 Pocket billards 

The term pocket billiards is used inconsistently in the article. Does it mean:
""""Pool or pocket billiards, generally played on a table with six pockets ..."""" where pocket billiards links to pool (cue sports)
or is it a generic name for all billiard [type] games played on a table with pockets as in its is used in the section Cue sports#Major games (carom and pocket). Because if the latter then the former is confusing and is further confused by the hatnote:

(Where """"Pocket billiards"""" links to Pool (cue sports)).

In a similar way the section Cue sports#List of cue sports says that """"English billiards (another hybrid)"""" of  """"Carom billiards games"""", but in the previous talk section we have established that it is not a hybrid (as it is at least as old as all modern billiard games and modern pocket-less Carom games), and if """"Snooker (see below; popularly regarded as its own sport, not a pool variant)"""" is its own sport so is English billiards.

If it can not be decided what """"Pocket billiards"""" means in American English and Commonwealth English then we should avoid using the term, or define what we mean by it before it is used in the article. Also I do not think that sources over 30 years old, should be used to define a term like """"Pocket billiards"""" as language changes and usage of such phrases does as well. Eg if the American professional organisations  have been pressing for it to mean pool type games, and snooker professional organisations tend not to use the term, then it is probably better to define it that American way and stick with that American usage in an article such as this.

If """"Pocket billiards"""" turns out not to have one meaning, and a definition can not be agreed upon then perhaps we should alter the section Cue sports#List of cue sports so that the list is either by table type sections, or by section based on the governing bodies of the various sports.

Hey Merzul, glad you have a sense of humor too.  There is actually a policy that admins are supposed to follow when a block might be controversial.  Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject.  According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me.  He did not do that.  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do.  And """"Final warning"""" suggests a previous warning had been given.  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse.  Oh well, what are you gonna do.  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think).  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too.   I suspect the """"batman"""" comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman).  But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority.  But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy. 

To be clear, I'm seeing this as idiotically funny and not ranting against admins or Wikipedia.  Anyhow, here's to appreciating the occassional absurdity in life!  19:15""",1,0

Thanks for your input at the Sesotho talk page. I guess it really does depend on one's experiences but I do believe that there are numerous rational justifications to use the names """"Sesotho"""" and """"Basotho"""" (eg. ambiguity of """"Sotho"""" which could refer to half a dozen different things) but I feel that the most important reason is that one should use the original form of the native name instead of arbitrarily modifying it (especially for a name which is not commonly used by average English speakers).

I am rather intrigued by how you peace corps guys manage to learn these languages so quickly and be able to use them in the countries.

What exactly do the peace corps do, exactly? Judging from the film """"eLollipop"""" it appears that it's mainly an international volunteer organisation that goes to poor countries to attempt to uplift the people at grassroots level  which sounds like a lot of fun (yes, I probably SHOULD take a look at the Wikipedia article and stop asking you this stuff).

Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.
 
You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.
 
Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.
SO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES. Cos all you know best is to play edit and block games on your scribblebook called wikipedia. Scribble on cos anyway no one cares and I most certainly don't. Time for you to go fishing then, LOSERQUEEN. And I wont bother to check any replies or anything else ever, cos I dont have time unlike Idle LOSERS like you, Loserqueen. You are no where near a queen, but certainly are a huge ,filled with trash, dustbin. Pity you, unfortunate daft-LOSER- DUSTBIN.

 Dubious sentence 

""""Consequently, Ney now organised a combined arms (infantry, artillery and cavalry) attack on La Haye Sainte, which fell as the defending King's German Legion troops ran out of ammunition. Ney then moved artillery up to the allied centre and began to pulverise the infantry squares.[73]""""

This is the final sentence of the French Cavalry attack section.

There seem to be several things wrong with it: first, attacking a building with cavalry is pointless, be they with infantry or not, second, field artillery have little effect on reasonably stout (like Belgian farmhouses) buildings, apart from shells setting them alight (which is what happened to the Chateau de Goumont, to little effect).

I think two events are being conflated here.  

Having become obvious that the cavalry on their own were achieving little, Ney organised a combined arms attack, using Bachelu's Division (Reille's Corps) and the remaining French cavalry in a fit enough state, towards the centre of Wellington's position, this was halted by the Household Brigade cavalry led by Uxbridge (who couldn't break the French infantry formations, and consequently the British cavalry then fell back). Uxbridge then tried to lead the Dutch-Belgian heavy cavalry into the attack but they refused to charge.  Meanwhile, Bachelu's men and their cavalry supports were being hard hit by artillery fire and eventually fell back themselves.  

Simultaneously, or thereabouts, elements of D'Erlon's Corps renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte, and were ultimately successful.

 

If you can reference all of that, be bold and put it in! - 

 Done (I'm bloody, bold and resolute - in Shakespeare's words ;)  ) 

 Artillery 

One omission and one challenge. 

We should say something about Wellington's tactic of having his gun crews seek shelter in the infantry squares during the cavalry attacks. There is also Mercer's account of not doing so because he reckoned if his men ran for the Brunswick squares next to them, the Brunswickers would run too. He gives a great eyewitness account of what happened to cuirassiers when you fired canister at them at point-blank range, too. 

Now the challenge. What's the source for there being only 54 guns in the Grand Battery? French """"batteries"""" (field brigades, or companies, perhaps, more correctly) had eight guns. There should have been either 48 or 56, i.e. 6 or 7 batteries, as otherwise it would imply at least one incomplete unit, or that some weapons were detached for some reason. I don't recall any suggestion from elsewhere that that happened. Were there perhaps 54 guns east of the Brussels road?  

Adkin, p. 296, has forty two 6lb, eighteen 12lb cannon, and six 6in and fourteen 5.5in howitzers - eighty pieces of ordnance in total from 10 artillery companies (of 8 pieces each).  This is for the period 1:00 to 1:30 pm.

6th Foot Artillery: 9th, 10th, 11th, 19th and 20th companies

8th                4th company

2nd                7th company

Marines of the Guard Foot Artillery: 2 companies (undifferentiated)

Old Guard Foot Artillery: 6th company.

 

Thanks - and those figures are consistent with what I know of French artillery organisation, i.e. each 8-gun foot artillery company had 6 guns and two howitzers. Your source shows 20 howitzers in total which says they had the howitzers of 10 companies, hence 80 guns - so it ties in. The eighteen 12-pounders would be the guns of three companies and the six 6in howitzers would have been theirs.

I wonder if someone miscounted by adding up just the guns and forgot to include the howitzers? That would get you close to 54 guns. Or perhaps 54 guns is what they had left after the Union Brigade got done with them.  

I vote we change it. At present the article implies that there was a 54-gun battery which covered the entire length of Wellington's position, and that this dilution of fire accounted for its relative ineffectiveness.  

By all means change it.

 Message to you, Mr Wales 

There are people I unequivocally despise. They lack morals, character, and honesty. They crush the remaining vestiges of democracy throughout the world. In case you can't tell, I'm talking about Mr. Jimbo Wales here. Let me cut to the chase: Wales says that everyone would be a lot safer if he were to monitor all of our personal communications and financial transactions—even our library records. Why on Earth does Wales need to monitor our library records? In classic sophist fashion, I ask another question in reply: Will Wales's shots to the heart of all that is wholesome buy him his long-sought victory for feckless charlatanism with its showy irreverence and glorification of all that is temeritous? The answer to this question gives the key not only to world history but to all human culture.

The next time someone says that Wales's analects enhance performance standards, productivity, and competitiveness, look that person right in the eye and reply, """"Wales is profoundly hostile to religious tolerance, democracy, and the notion of a secular civil society."""" I plan to hone in on his faults with laser-like precision. This is a choice I have made; your choice is up to you. But let me remind you that when Wales says that he has a fearless dedication to reason and truth, that's just a load of spucatum tauri. It is our responsibility to ensure that he doesn't lock all the exits from our present state to the world of constructive reason. I state these facts only to give a bit of personal background as to why I fully intend to stop the Huns at the gate. That's the path that I have chosen. It's definitely not an easy path, but then again, Wales somehow manages to get away with spreading lies (society is supposed to be lenient towards impudent blackguards), distortions (his randy coalition is a respected civil-rights organization), and misplaced idealism (our elected officials should be available for purchase by special-interest groups). However, when I try to respond in kind, I get censored faster than you can say """"predisadvantageously"""".

Carnaptious primates are born, not made. That dictum is as unimpeachable as the """"poeta nascitur, non fit"""" that it echoes and as irreproachable as the brocard that when I hear Wales say that doing the fashionable thing is more important than life or liberty, I have to wonder about him. Is he entirely bitter? Is he simply being mawkish? Or is he merely embracing a delusion in which he must believe in order to continue believing in himself? If you were to ask that of Wales, he'd certainly fling a large barrage of insults in your direction instead of actually addressing the question. He has spent untold hours trying to make empty promises. During that time, did it ever once occur to him that his strictures are a mockery of all that is fair and equitable?

Secondly, Schindler's heroism is widely recognized all over the world, while Winton is mostly known by the British who are extremely well-known for loudly bragging about things they never accomplished. He is a purely media-made hero. And third of all, the children he saved were thrown out of their homes in Britain as soon as the war ended.

baadb58fb9c1fdcf,"Hi Enrico! 

Thank you for your message and kind words; they're very much appreciated!   
Thank you also for the correction you're suggesting. I will look into the sources I used for the Planxty reunion dates and locations, and then update this section later on. Normally, I would do this straight away but I am quite busy at the moment and will be for the next few days. However, please know that I will definitely aim to fix this if I can, as I am always striving to ensure there is a third-party source for everything I contribute to the encyclopaedia. Of course, if some of these 3rd-party sources are wrong, then it's going to be tricky!
I also notice that you are a brand new user, who has made your first edit today, and to my user page! So, a very warm welcome to you and I hope you will enjoy your time here, either as a reader or maybe also as a contributing editor. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if your user and/or talk pages get supdated very soon with a 'Welcome' message from editors who like to take 'newbies' (= newcomers) under their wings.  
But if you look at my user page, you will see that I collected a lot of links to Wikipedia articles that provide details about editorial guidelines, such as the 'Manual Of Style' (Wiki:MOS). May I also suggest that, if you want some help in getting started as an editor, you can ask me and I will edit a few pointers in your own user- and talk-pages. You don't *have* to do any of these things, but if you're interested and have the time, then I'l be happy to help you in your first steps. So, just let me know, OK?
Finally, although I made quite a few changes to the 'Planxty' article (and especially to the 'Andy Irvine (musician)' article), one of the essential principles of our encyclopaedia is that these articles do not 'belong' to any one editor: we all contribute what we can without any article ever becoming 'mine'. In my case, I just happen to have been a Planxty (and Irvine) fan  for a long time and had kept a lot of reference material (mainly my collection of folk music magazines) that proved very useful to update the articles. I am still working on the Irvine article and the next tasks will be to create related articles for some of the albums. Then, of course, we need more photos but these are very difficult to include because of the copyright rules in Wikipedia.",0,0

What is this drivel?

That Hüttenbrenner neither had the work performed, nor even let the society know he had the manuscript is curious and has spawned various theories. Was he given an incomplete score by Schubert and was waiting for the rest before saying anything? If so, he waited in vain throughout the six remaining years of Schubert's life. After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't Hüttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died? Could personality factors like introvertedness or jealousy have been at play here?",1,0

Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that """"fuck"""" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word """"fuck,"""" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what """"fuck"""" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning """"fuck"""" (or """"fucking"""") and the euphemism """"sleeping together"""" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. 

If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as """"fuck"""" and """"sleeping together"""" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and """"fuck"""" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word """"fuck"""" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why """"fuck"""" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that """"fuck"""" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. 

Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you """"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."""" 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include """"fuck."""" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   """,1,1

The tank losses extremely biased

The Indian tank losses are exaggerated at atleast 175 tanks this means some Pakistani wants to believe that even more than 200 Indian tanks were destroyed. And the Pakistani tanks losses are put at minimal 200 tanks. The original source is US library which i dont consider as neutral at all considering the fact that US was a supporter of Pakistan. The losses dont reflect the fact that Pakistan lost almost all major battles of """"Khem Karan"""", """"Phillora"""",""""Burki"""" and even at Chawinda according to pakistan general himself pakistan lost 34 tanks(india claim 57tanks) on the other hand Pakistan exaggerate its claim to 120 tanks(India accept only 29 tanks) more importantly at Khem Karan and Phillora Indian army put on display some 100 tanks at khem karan and 58 tanks at phillora then how is it that pakistan losses are mere 200 and Indian losses """"Atleast 175"""" a complete lie. 

Spencer C Tucker one of the most renowned military historian puts pakistan losses at 300 tanks(Indian claimed 494 tanks) and Indian losses at 150 tanks(Pakistan claimed 290tanks).

http://books.google.co.in/books?id=N481TmqiSiUC&pg;=PA172&lpg;=PA172&dq;=pakistan+tank+losses+1965&source;=bl&ots;=O9UCZHbyUs&sig;=-oILZn-csKxRzDXKPkNF3-dGEPY&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=rZsOUPWhENHirAfzuIDoBg&ved;=0CFUQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q;=pakistan%20tank%20losses%201965&f;=false

All the Indian editors plz focus on this the neutral losses are represnted by US figures which i think are biased and further Spencer C Tucker is also one of the most renowned historian , even Stanley Wolpart and Jeremy Black made it clear that at the end of war Indian Army has Twice the number of tanks(Pakistan started with more tanks when war started).

All the Indian editors must raise this issue as some pakistani editors think that by peddling lies they will win the 1965 war.

8a4dc0f945aa2fc6,"Process question re arbitration remedies 

Pure curiosity only, so apologies in advance if I end up being one of a stream of people knocking at your door today, but I'm genuinely wondering. I noticed that the remedies in the date delinking case were updated based on the revisions that were passed recently. I'm just wondering if there's a usual way that the case page is updated for something like this? It appears that you overwrote the new remedies on top of the old ones, with the original date and vote totals remaining in place — as a result, without checking the history, it looks as though that were the original remedy. In a different remedy revised earlier, the new remedy was entered with the current date and vote total, and the original remedy was placed into a collapse box. It's probably as simple as different clerks, different approaches, but I guess I was a little surprised there's no defined process for something like this. Regards,",0,0

This personage, it is stated, had two sons, Muirich Mhor and Dhai Dhu. From the former of these was descended Clan Mhuirich or Macpherson, and from the latter Clan Dhai or Davidson.

Hallo Acpbg,

thanks for answering to my revert! I wrote the voice, so I am trying always to do some housekeeping on it... -)

As a matter of fact, I think there here there are two problems:

according to what you wrote, the name of the peak refers to the Treaty, not to the village; so it should go under the Treaty of San Stefano voice.

here I answer with an example: according to your philosophy, in the voice Rome there should be a list of the (about) 53 settlements, mountains, and so on, which take names from the eternal city. This makes no sense, but make sense to write on each single voice about its etymology.

Last but not least, the information that you write in the article is out of context in the place where you wrote it.

Do you see my reasons now?

 Concerning point 1, Milburn is a student, by his own statement on his Wikipedia page, studying philosophy in Lancaster. What could possibly be insulting in saying that he is a student, while I myself have been ... (not relevant)? I expect some respect from someone who could be my own child if not student. 

 Concerning your point 2, please read my talk page, and you will see that rather than insulting Milburn, I have just stated facts. Milburn has been writing to me that he is a """"dedicated"""" and """"experienced"""" editor. Why should this have been relevant to me? I had already told him, in no uncertain terms, that I had left the issue to Stifle to decide upon. Yet, Milbrun kept writing to me that while Stifle was an experienced editor, he was also experienced. All these, in the face of the fact that I had never said him anything to the contrary! I had just said that we, i.e. I and Milburn, disagreed on the issue of the photograph of Michael Foot and therefore it was best if the issue was dealt with by someone else. Why had I to be constantly told things that he kept telling me? Read his messages and count the number of times that he has written to me that I did not understand certain things! 

 What could possibly be wrong with being a student in Lancaster? In point of fact, University of Lancaster has one of the best, if not the best, laboratories of law-temperature physics world-wide. If there are ten great low-temperature physicists in the world, thee of them are in Lancaster (they have over long periods of time had the world records of lowest temperatures ever achieved in laboratory; they were the main figures behind the dilution refrigerator, etc.). No, you are utterly mistaken if you believe that I meant something negative by referring to University of Lancaster - some of my best and most respected colleagues are working there (I even was their guest sometimes ago), one of them also a mathematician of great international standing.

 I hope I have made it abundantly clear that there is nothing disrespectful in my writings about J. Milburn as a person, as well as about his contributions (I simply do not know his and his contributions). I just happened to disagree with him on his tagging this photograph for deletion. That is why I suggested to him, already yesterday, that rather than arguing, we left the matter to be decided on by Stifle. That is all, insofar as I am concerned. It is J. Milburn who has kept filling my talk page with his messages after messages, telling me that I were wrong and that I did not understand certain things. """,0,0

ccae0f992866166e,"2004 Bonnie? What about Charley? 

I recall Hurricanes Bonnie and Charley hitting Florida within a day of each other, and both of them passing off the Jersey Shore a few days later.  It was the remnants of Charley, not Bonnie, which brought the heaviest rain to the Jersey Shore on August 15th, 2004. Bonnie might have spread some light rain a day or two earlier, I don't specifically remember, but Charley passed off our coast as a 40 mile per hour tropical storm. I remember this clearly because the most intense wind and rain were far ahead of Charley's center, and when the center was closest, there was no rain or wind to speak of onshore, mostly offshore. Earlier that day, Charley had been a Category One hurricane off of South Carolina, and a day or two before that, a monster Category 4, hitting Punta Gorda, Florida. Later that season, New Jersey got rains from the remnants of Frances, Gaston, Ivan & Jeanne. Jeanne was the strongest, and brought the most intense winds of that season, although Charley was far wetter. I will try to find sources to back this up, but I have followed every New Jersey tropical storm & hurricane since 1976, and work in the Office of Emergency Management. Some of the worst conditions I've ever experienced were during the passage of Tropical Storm Ernesto in 2006, because the wind and rain lasted a long, long time: about two days, with frequent gusts near hurricane force, even over that threshold just south of here..  Floyd, Bertha, Gloria and Belle were  stronger, but they moved faster. My community, Seaside Heights was in the direct center of 70 mph Tropical Storm Floyd in 1999, with a dead calm lasting about an hour, sandwiched between periods very, very wind conditions. Hanna in '08 was the biggest wimp of all these storms: a bit of rain and wind, but mostly hype.

I looked up the history of Bonnie and Charley from the National Hurricane Center.

Bonnie, http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2004bonnie.shtml? passed east of the Jersey Shore, and probably did bring light rain, but it was not memorable

Two days later, on the 15th, Charley, http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2004charley.shtml?  did the same, but in a much more dramatic way.

I am going to add this to the page. Thanks.

I agree with Fred. Viridae, I'm going to pretend for a moment that I believe the SlimVirgin engaged in abusive sockpuppetry. The account had not been used for two years, so there was no urgency. There is a precedent for letting people in similar situations give a private explanation, and only to sanction them if they refuse or fail. It was not possible to provide public evidence without giving further publicity to a website which engages in stalking, and which gave speculation about not only SlimVirgin's identity, but also another contributor's. And you seem to be overlooking the fact that Cyde was in a longstanding dispute with SlimVirgin, so obviously should not have been the one to block. See also . This is not a question of making a mistake in believing WordBomb. This is a question of believing WordBomb, and then, instead of reporting it privately to the ArbCom, or asking SlimVirgin privately for an explanation, engaging in extremely inappropriate, hasty, behaviour, even crowing over the person he was accusing of sockpuppetry, and showing most clearly that he had a grudge against her. Additionally, in another case which is being heard at the moment, a user who had originally registered with his real name requested a name change, and repeatedly asked people not to keep referring to him by his old name, and Cyde responded by provocatively posting a link to the user rename log.

ONIH has not addressed the issue, and he has also not answered my question.  

1. I said small would be more appropriate relative to """"minor"""" - """"""""Minor"""" reflects a point of view. """"Small"""" would be more appropriate.""""  Most appropriate would be to not have any modifier.  If the split was so minor, why are so many people still ticked off about it?  And it's not fair to say that the RSF folks left the movement, they just continued pursuing a direction they had pursued for years.  The """"movement"""" is bigger than PSF and PIRA.

2. I did not state that Peter Taylor is a """"mere journalist.""""  If I did, my apologies to Peter Taylor.  Indeed, please point it out where I used the phrase """"mere journalist."""" 

I did state that he has written some excellent books.  For better or worse, historians are not journalists.  They have different schools for each, in fact.  Provos accompanied a documentary broadcast; it's a great publication, but it's not a detailed history of the Provisional IRA.  The wikiepedia entry for Peter Taylor states, """"Peter Taylor born Scarborough, North Yorkshire is a British journalist and documentary-maker who had covered for many years the political and armed conflict in Northern Ireland, the so-called Troubles. From his experience he has written and produced books and television documentaries on the Northern Irish conflict.""""  The entry for J. Bowyer Bell states, """"The Troubles began in Northern Ireland in 1969, and Bell's The Secret Army: the IRA 1916-1970 was published the following year, and was one of the first detailed histories of the IRA along with The IRA by Tim Pat Coogan which was also published in 1970.""""  Many of the people that Taylor interviewed were also interviewed by Bell; and Bell probably interviewed them first and, in some cases, more than once (though Taylor probably interviewed several people multiple times, too).  

3. One Night In Hackney states above that he """" wasn't using one source over another, I was using what the source actually said.""""  But Bell clearly states, as noted above, """"Ruairi O Bradaigh, Daithi O Conaill, and about one hundred others walked out to form Republican Sinn Fein.""""  So, the sources disagree.  At one point, I believe, the word """"twenty"""" was in there.  It is not in there now, and from my view this is appropriate.  If the sources disagree we should not choose one over the other, but instead we should either acknowledge the differences and quote from each or find a way to be neutral  not quoting from either.

4. Once again there has been a dispute in which One Night in Hackney has chosen one source over another and then when confronted with a direct quotation from an alternate source he has chosen to ask questions, change the subject, and deny the validity of the source.  The reality is that Taylor and Bell are both valid sources, and Bell was clearly talking about people walking out of the Ard-Fheis.  Bell might have been wrong, Taylor might be wrong, but we as Wikipedia editors are not in a position to make that determination.  To do so is to engage in Original Research. WH.

And the person going around erasing all my comments to hide them from outsiders calls himself a """"Rambling Man"""". Very apt. This isn't an encyclopedia, it's a playground.

Presumably the use of the phrase """"Bishonen with her finger on the trigger"""" over there waa meant to be funny, but given the context of my complaint, it's just rather tragic. Still, back to the real world, where the Trayvon Martin case is actually real news, and the issues it involves are of encyclopedic value. I've found the articles myself without the help of the front page, but apparently anyone else looking for them can just go to hell (in a bucket?). All, you Lords, Hell Buckets and Rambling men get back to whatever the fuck it is you do around here, which is cleearly not creating a useful encyclopedia (at least you don't seem to be getting in the way of the people who actually managed to write the articles on the shooting and trial, so thank fuck for that).""",1,0

i don't think cows can be tipped either, but this is hardly an article that meets wikipedia policy/guidelines/standards for clarity, neutrality, or good writing. the second paragraph, for example, is badly written, pretend-intellectual humoro-babble for the sole purpose of setting up the inclusion of the cutesy, unnecessary phrase """"precarious ruminants"""". the refrigerator example is strained, nowhere mentioning center of gravity. rather, it encourages a lower center of gravity than an honest attempt to simulate a cow would have, while making sure to reduce the lever. that's just the start. i would hack/slash my way through the thing, but i can tell from the history that it's the pet of some watching worshipers.

ea624bb4d78034dd,"Britain's strategy of turning Germany eastwards to destroy USSR

Hey, I want to add in the view that Chamberlain's strategy was to turn Germany eastwards to destroy USSR. That view seems to be missing here. 

...And by this date, certain members of the Milner Group and of the British Conservative government had reached the fantastic idea that they could kill two birds with one stone by setting Germany and Russia against one another in Eastern Europe.

In this way they felt that the two enemies would stalemate one another, or that Germany would become satisfied with the oil of Rumania and the wheat of the Ukraine.

It never occurred to anyone in a responsible position that Germany and Russia might make common cause, even temporarily, against the West.  Even less did it occur to them that Russia might beat Germany and thus open all Central Europe to Bolshevism.

This idea of bringing Germany into a collision with Russia was not to be found, so far as the evidence shows, among any members of the inner circle of the Milner Group.

Rather it was to be found among the personal associates of Neville Chamberlain, including several members of the second circle of the Milner Group.  The two policies followed parallel courses until March 1939.  After that date the Milner Group’s disintegration became very evident, and part of it took the form of the movement of several persons (like Hoare and Simon) from the second circle of the Milner Group to the inner circle of the new group rotating around Chamberlain...''

This has been discussed here and elsewhere, including talk pages linked to from this section (that is, #Iran).

Request for Clarification

Hello, Arthur Rubin (congratulations on your recent promotion to admin here at Wikipedia!). Your friend the Hillman agent seems to be MIA, so I'll be waiting until he/she/it gets back to renew my discussions with him/her/it. But as it happens, I just noticed that you responded to me in the CTMU AfD as follows:
 
""""The only kind of theory capable of 'resolving an intractable paradox of physical science' is a theory formulated on a level above that of the paradox itself; thus, using the theory, one can define a function which resolves the paradox by mapping its (otherwise conflicting) elements consistently into observables. [That was me; now here's you:] WP:BOLLOCKS. Well, perhaps, not, but no such (intractable) paradox is discussed here. — Arthur Rubin | (talk) ."""" 

I'm very sorry that I wasn't able to respond to you when you made that comment - too much going on for me to notice it at the time, I'm afraid. But now that it has come to my attention, I'm struck by its ambiguity. Do you mean that science generates no intractable paradoxes in the conventional or computational sense? (If so, I'd like to know how you've managed to deduce this.) Do you mean that such paradoxes may in fact exist, but that the resolutions are necessarily scientific as opposed to interpretative? (If so, I'd again like to know your reasoning.) Or do you simply mean that the CTMU - an unquestionably notable theory which was covered by large-circulation elements of the popular media, but whose Wikipedia article you nevertheless helped to delete - doesn't have anything to do with such paradoxes? 

I ask, of course, because you are a """"relatively famous Wikipedian"""" who participated in getting that article deleted, and as an important mathematician, must understand quite a bit indeed! More importantly, because you have taken it upon yourself to help arbit the math-science-pseudomath/science-philosophy distinction here at Wikipedia, I think we all need to make sure that you thoroughly understand it, and are not letting misconceptions contribute to possible conflicts of interest on the parts of other Wikipedians.

I had posted a topic about a band that has been labeled emo, only for someone to delete it. Stating that """"it is completely off topic, unproductive, unrelated to this article, and that belongs in a discussion forum"""" Hello, this is a discussion forum for the emo page, if we have an issue with something on it, it's suppose to be displayed here and talked over. Do not delete peoples post because YOU think it doesn't fit to YOUR standards, it's for people to talk on.

With that, I repost my statement to WHY Coheed and Cambria are not emo.

First off, I'd like to take the time to say. Read this, and don't reply UNLESS you are agreeing, or are going to change this matter. If you are just going to sit there and whine because you are wrong about something, I don't want to hear it.

So here we begin...

Each song that Coheed and Cambria has made, has gone in flow with a comic that Claudio Shanchez (Lead Singer) has thought of in that brilliant mind of his. Some might claim some of the songs emo due to a few lyrics. Well, how else would you explain a painful moment, or happy moment in a story? A rhyme about whatever the heck """"junk in a trunk"""" is? No, you'd have an explanation of the characters pain and happiness.

Perhaps you should read some stuff from wiki itself. 
Within The Amory Wars page, (The comic made by Claudio)

""""The story follows the adventure of Claudio Kilgannon across the fictional solar system, far in the past known as Heaven's Fence, in an attempt to seek help from his Uncle, after his parents are tricked into murdering Claudio's siblings, and then murdered themselves by the Supreme Tri-Mage and ruler of Heaven's Fence, Wilhelm Ryan.""""

All of their songs came from a point in the story, if you had known the story, you'd not tag them as emo at all. Because in fact they are not, it's a story. Get over it and stop with all of this """"scene"""" stuff. 

It's all a story, unlike other bands that cry and scream about """"I want to die, no one understands me, I have it so bad, My girlfriend left me because I am whiny""""

Understand what I am pointing out?

Emo is the most ridiculous label ever, yet sadly it is here and people wont let it die willingly. 
So, why not research bands before you label. While you are at it, read the Coheed and Cambria comics, they are quite the epic. This now ending my humble opinion on this matter of why they shouldn't be in this """"Emo label"""" scene.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Doesn't matter if they are or aren't emo.  They're listed here as a band that has been called emo.  In fact, that's the point of the paragraph - to demonstrate how nebulous the term is.

If you want the related Wikipedia guidelines - all we have to do is supply a reliable source (per WP:RS) that confirms that C&C; have been called emo.  Source.  That's it.  That's all we need.  Any amount of rambling about how they are or aren't emo is irrelevant.  

And you trust MTV? The people that don't even play music anymore, pathetic. Well, I counter your source with mine.  Source.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Did you really read what I wrote?  It doesn't matter if they're emo or not.  We're not using C&C; as an example of an emo band, we're using C&C; as an example of a band that's been called emo.  They've been called emo, so they're mentioned.  Period.

(BTW - click on the """"tag"""" page of your """"source"""".)  

Honestly, I read it. But I don't give a damn what you wrote. Apparently you are one of those """"I must be right, or heaven shall fall"""" type of people. But, yet again. So you're making your own rules for Wikipedia now? You know, the public place? ....Cute.

But, as always there is that one prick in the crowd. You know what though, KoRn sings about sad matters, about how they are lonely and scared little boys and no one gets them. Maybe they should be on that list of """"exmaples"""", I've heard them be called emo before. (This is a retort, personally I like KoRn) With that.

 Q factor definition in the context of individual reactive components 

In the context of individual reactive passive components (e.g. inductors & capacitors), I'm familiar with the following definition: 

The aforementioned definition is presented, in some form, in section Individual reactive components of the article, however, the section Definition of the quality factor has no mentioning of it. Instead, the following definition is presented:

a definition which is practically the same as the other energy-based definition in the section, and furthermore, includes a reference to 
James W. Nilsson's Electric Circuits 1989 edition. I've went through a recent (much newer) edition of the book, and found no energy-based definition of any kind for Q - whether for resonator circuits or individual components.
I therefore tagged the reference as """"Failed verification"""", and additionally, I wonder what is the point of this definition, which is practically the same as the previous one in the article. It seems to me that one of them is superfluous.

I'm rather interested what part of your statement did I misinterpreted? As for German collaborators - I do have evidence, that AK soldiers killed Lithuanians who were volunteers in  Lithuanian Wars of Independence, and had nothing to do with Nazi government. yes thay did kill family of one Policemen, and one Policemen - but killing family with little children is not the same as kill collaborator, don't you think?  But well, I might be overreacting, as I've read the Lithuanian commission material and it is quite difficult to remain calm after reading how, for example, AK did shoot a teacher in the school, holding her two years child in her hands, or stabbed a child lying in a cradle with a bayonet and held him in the air until he stopped moving, and many more facts of """"punishing collaborators"""". BTW, I do have full statement of this commission, and it clearly states that AK  did commit manslaughter and crimes against humanity. It's official document, not some newspaper interpretation.

 GayVN Awards redirects 

Thanks for your help in deleting the pages that were merged. However, I'm disappointed that the redirects weren't deleted, regardless of how """"cheap"""" they are. 

I can't find anything that says redirects have to be kept in the case of merging a page. (Which would make sense in most cases, I'm sure, but not when the name of the merged page is not one that someone would likely search for.) I can, however, find support for deleting them. Wikipedia:Redirect#When should we delete a redirect?, item 1. states, """"The redirect page makes it unreasonably difficult for users to locate similarly named articles via the search engine.""""

I believe that leaving the redirects meets this guideline. Here's the top of the results list when searching for """"gayvn"""", in order of appearance. There are 51 results listed. Redirects are marked (R); correct pages are bolded. Non-existent pages are italicized.

Having to slog through 15 extraneous """"hits"""" for non-useful redirect pages seems unreasonable to me; it's nearly a third of the search results. The redirects aren't useful as they are too specific to be considered likely search phrases.

User:24.167.138.84 may exist, but 24.167.138.84 is a volatile IP address. Keeping a comment directed at a particular user of a volatile IP address that may never be used by that particular user again, about a page that has been merged/deleted, seems needless. While equally useless, for some reason he doesn't show up in the search list. (More evidence that there's something wrong with the index.)

User:Overdrive10/Kent Larson and User:Overdrive10/Chris Steele show up further down on the list as well; neither of these pages contains any reference to GayVN (they're both blank); I'm sure they did in the past as they were probably sandboxes for articles. However, there has been no activity on either page since 16 June. 

User:Fabartus/Sandbox also shows up in the search results but doesn't mention GayVN anywhere on that page; nor has s/he done so since 13 April. That entry appears to be part of a copy and paste of another user's contributions log with comments, and was created by a user with an IP address (most likely Fabartus's, however).

In these cases and the case of the two pages listed above that don't actually exist but are being returned as part of the search results, I think there's an obvious """"glitch"""" somewhere - apparently in the search engine indexing. Is it not being refreshed on a regular basis? I thought it happened every 24 hours.

Any road, it would be nice to have the 15 redirect pages removed and their entries in the search results eliminated (and I'm not sure that the former results in the latter). Equally desirable would be to have the search index updated to reflect the non-existence of pages. Is that something that you can do, or know to whom a request should be made to do so?

Any chance of some further assistance here?

Fear not, pop-eyed little pooch, your point was well taken. You hardly need to remind me that you don't give a """"flying fart""""  about sticking to facts or veracity (although you're very free with low-level sharts here, I've noticed). Happily though, others do. So on second thoughts I'll keep this section—to exhibit, for the appreciation of my other visitors (fully house-trained!), the remarkable specimens produced by my little doggie friend. I shall call them my Little Mexican Doggy Whoppers.

So now you've changed your story of The Hours for the third time, eh? (Or is it fourth? Fifth? I seem to be losing count as you approach the limits of my pitifully deficient arithmetic.) If I, er, comprehend it correctly, the latest draft of The Hours has it that you originally """"thought"""" five hours was """"about"""" two hours. Interesting.  And revealing. In fact you sniffily dismissed the interval as """"less than 2 hours"""" (my emph.). Interesting and revealing because? Because the open-ended """"about"""" tends to support a story of an innocent """"estimate"""".  But """"less than"""" doesn't. """"Less than"""" is specifically limited. Narrowed in focus, specific, it's more clearly a calculated (no pun intended) lie. It's well-known that most liars have trouble remembering which lie they told. Less well-known is the fact that their use of words, trivial though words seem to them, often gives them away. Freudian slips? Elementary, my dear Watson. 

By the way there's a good book by Adventures In The Screen Trade author and screenwriter Bill Goldman called, I think, Which Lie Did I Tell? It's about Hollywood. Are you a Hollywood pooch? Sporting a diamond collar from Harry Winston and peeking out of a B-list celebrity's purse? If so I may be able to sell your crap on eBay, and I insist that you think of this section as your special little pooping place! (Gives a whole new meaning to """"save your crap"""" doesn't it!)

bdce6413646ed339,"Wow.

In the last month (and excepting my message this afternoon), I have on one (1) occasion interacted with Heymid. I told him that instead of just removing information that has a clear, explicit source, it would be better to explain why in the talk page for the concerned article, then wait for others so get a chance to respond.

During October, Heymid was blocked a third or fourth time for, well, doing what he always has and probably always will since he gets away with it. He appealed this block, the appeal was denied, then he appealed again, promising pretty much the same stuff he had promised when trying to have previous blocks lifted. I wrote nothing when he was blocked, nothing when he first appealed, nothing when the first appeal was denied, nothing when he appealed again and nothing when he was unblocked. Yet you feel that I'm popping up at every venue, and when I did write a single message at somebody else's talk page, you immediately blocked me, without any warning, without any message in my talk page.

I'm not sure if this is funny or sad or both. What I do know, however, is that I have absolutely no intent to appeal the block, so you might just as well remove my talk page access as well. -",0,0

6c6decf4f3ecb5fe,"""This is ridiculous. """"It makes Iranians look stupid""""...? Who the fuck are you? A political commentator? An outspoken, self-proclaimed expert on contemporary Iranian politics? Oh right, my pen-name is The Persian Cataphract, so let me try to decipher your next tactical move. The race card? Oh right, your name's not Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson. Let me guess the next one. Nationalist. That's right, you'll throw each and every syllable of content present in my message, in favour of this preconceived straw-man, fallacy and red herring. You'll probably even point to my liberal use of profanity. I just must be nothing else than this lion-and-sun foam-at-mouth Persian nationalist with an inferiority complex spiced with a pinch of victim mentality. And certainly I must be dumb, as you so eloquently have arbitrated above.

You said it yourself, right here:

...I am used to being attacked by editors whose very account names show they are here for single-topic pov-pushing. Who do you expect to be neutral on topics of Iranian nationalism? A user called """"IranianGuy"""", or a Swiss editor contributing under his real name and no stakes in the matter? Who, for that matter, do you expect to be neutral on topics of Armenian nationalism, an editor called """"AraratArev"""" (vel sim.)...

Is that how you assess content? By making a shallow assumption on pen-names? Expectations? The God-given right to anonymity on the Internet? How fucking petty are you and the idiot who made you an administrator? What next, are you going to ban Iranians from editing or contributing to Iran-related articles? Indeed not just a laughable policy, but indeed a dangerous one as well. Most of the world-class authorities are Iranians. With your fucked up logic, we should dismiss their contributions because irrespective of their content, you'll instead look at their political affiliations and their names and put it into the bin of rejection. Oh right, you're Swiss and because Switzerland is this shining paragon of neutrality hosting thousands of bank accounts of Islamic terror organization, you're obviously this stereotypical neutralist... Good lord, listen to yourself. 

Luckily academia doesn't work like that. Scholarly enterprise and political affiliations remain strictly separated. So it doesn't really matter if Kaveh Farrokh or anyone else is a self-declared outspoken Nazi, Communist, Socialist, Liberal, Conservative or what have you, it has no bearing on content that must be assessed purely by content. That's NPOV. A sober, neutral, objective approach, just bare-bones, bare-knuckles source critique. Source. Critique. Make an assessment on the content, not the person(s). You marginalized IranianGuy. Period. And as conveniently as you shrugged him off because of his pen-name, you shrugged off his fully legitimate criticism of your approach. No matter what country or pen-name or real name you have, it has a universal stamp: Asshole behaviour.

Anyway, in most religions, scripture doesn't necessarily dictate religious practice, that's not even the case with religions that have more literalist approaches to religious life, such as Islam. Many things Muslims do as a practice of religion are outside of the Qur'an. I imagine the same is true for Hinduism. Anyway, we don't have the authority to go into that level of analysis. If we had to contrast what a source says regarding what's 'religiously sanctioned', against actual scripture, we'd be engaging in original research. We'd be pretending that we're religious scholars. I found a reliable source that said something, and I edited accordingly.
 Because of all the wikilawyering here, I'm having to almost quote my sources without violation copyright. The source called it 'religiously sanctioned', and that's the phrase I used.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
March 7, 2012

Mr. JONES submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary

CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
Expressing the sense of Congress that the use of offensive military force by a President without prior and clear authorization of an Act of Congress constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor under article II, section 4 of the Constitution.

Whereas the cornerstone of the Republic is honoring Congress's exclusive power to declare war under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that, except in response to an actual or imminent attack against the territory of the United States, the use of offensive military force by a President without prior and clear authorization of an Act of Congress violates Congress's exclusive power to declare war under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution and therefore constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor under article II, section 4 of the Constitution.",0,0

Until I and another person started working on the Eiffel article a few weeks ago it was a disgrace, full of inaccuracies and opinions, with almost no factual information on the language. Apparently that was not a reason to complain. Now that we are devoting our time to producing a good article with the same standards of quality as a scientific publication we are being heckled by people who only care about enforcing some font commonality.

I wonder if you realize the harm that you are doing to Wikipedia by harassing the designer of the very technology that the article describes.

I am a greek mythology nut case. I like the greek god Hades a lot. Which is why I am asking this question. The reason why I got concerned about the whole topic. Was I read what look like the source on the Cyclopes page. After I read the play it was not anywhere on there. I later found out that I mis understood what. Gold Dragon said. I got mad about it. Because I dont trust Wikipedia. Right now Wikipedia is the only source I can find that says. Zeus returned the Cyclopes from Hades. After their death. So what I am asking is what kind of sources do you use on everything. I hope dont just repeat stuff from unreilable sources. Do you use published sources. One's that can be trusted.

Here's my five cents: I do not think it is practical to give coords for a middle point of Routes. I have looked around a bit and the only place I happened to find such coords is in Bundesautobahn 2. In this example there is an important junction in a city near the centre, so it makes sense, but in some Routes like Route 10 which consist of 3 or more separate fragments, defining any """"central"""" point on them is too arbitrary. Also some routes are important and wide for a part of their length only, so their """"middle"""" is not anything to go by. I would be happy with 2 points, but I know this is not practical in searching. I think an important destination (city or big town) somewhere between 1/3 and 2/3 of their length should be picked.

I assume good faith on your part, UserQuiddity, because you have always been a gentleman. Accordingly either you are mistaken, or Wikipedia is subject to easy fandalism, because the facts, as I know them are substantially different from your presentation. The page in question is Jewish Bolshevism, which is a so called noun + adjetive expression (according to Wikipedians). The fact is that those who explain or justify the hatred of Jews are crackpots and Antisemites. My position is simple: Jewish Bolshivism has only an antisemitic meaning, interpretation, usage, justification, etc. I am not responsible for the fact that that Draius/red (whatever his difficult to remember name is) user deduced that I have insulted him. The insult was his own deduction. I did not hurl at him any insult. And that term popsucker is just my paraphrase of the other dofficult Wiki word for a Wikipedia who disguises his identity.

I am not the founder, I am a contributor citing the founder's definition which I was able to find online, as the most appropriate definition of what the organization is. 

What you are suggesting is absurd. You are saying that it is not appropriate to inquire what the group is about directly from the creator instead relying on the opinion of someone else who clearly is opposed to what the group represents. 

Lets look at this from a more personal view. Do either of these argument examples seem resonable when applied to other topics?

Example 1. You are Jewish and tried to argue that; in a Wiki entry about """"Nazisim Beginnings"""", Hitlers definition of how the Nazi party got (perhaps extracted verbatim from Mein Kampf, would be less relevant than say Alan Dershowitz's thoughts on the topic extracted from an Op-Ed peice in the Times, because in your view, Hitler's definition seemed to one-sided and preachy.

Example 2. I am black and tried to argue that Louis Farrakhan would more neutrally write the """"Overview"""" entry for the """"Leakey Foundation"""" than the groups namesake Louis Leakey. The reason I give for this choice is that """"to use Leakey's comments on the subject, no matter how precise his summary, could only be a """"soapbox"""" for his opinion and agenda.

Does either example seem reasonable to you if you can access the source and get an unadulterated definition?

The entry I am including is very thorough, and includes highly important information such as founding members, date of origination, what they believe, what they don't believe, and anything someone researching the group would want to find out. You have a userbox for """"This user is opposed to online censorship."""" but that is clearly your intent here as you are simply removing relevant information under the thin argument of """"saving the world from a soapbox"""". I am not on a soapbox. I want to get the most information out there as possible. """,0,0

 More content and sources to be added 

The suggestion made above that this article could be deleted or merged as not notable represents a truly extraordinary """"reach"""". As was noted previously, the specific phrase that gives this article its title is used and discussed in literature from sources as diverse as the Air Force Research Institute and Israel's own Goldstone Mission report, which employes it extensively. Already mentioned in the article, is the (also extensive) discussion of the term in a report by the internationally recognized human rights organization, the Public Committee Against Torture in IsraelNo Second Thoughts: The Changes in the Israeli Defense Forces Combat Doctrine in Light of Operation Cast Lead, a report by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel; executive summary, with full report discussing Dahiya doctrine also downloadable at no cost.

Not yet mentioned are papers from the Brookings Institution, one of the most prominent thinktanks in the world, where a new-this-month analysis also discusses the doctrine in considerable depth.The Next War: How Another Conflict Between Hizballah and Israel Could Look and How Both Sides Are Preparing For It, an August 2011 analysis paper by the Brookings Institution; executive summary, with full report discussing Dahiya doctrine also downloadable at no cost.. Nor are any of the multiple scholarly articles that use and discuss the phrase and the policy it identifies mentioned in the article; see footnote.Search Google Scholar for """"Dahiya doctrine"""" (some sifting and use of spelling variants required); one example that discusses the concept under this name at some length is Legislative Attack, by Eyal Weizman, published in 2010 by the highly-ranked journal Theory, Culture & Society. A full-text copy can currently be downloaded from here, at a site that appears to correspond to a university course offering by its author.

Dershowitz even uses and discusses the phrase, as do Noam ChomskyNoam Chomsky interview in """"City"""" magazine, Tel Aviv edition, available on Chomsky's website or in its original context, here, at the magazine's site. and Norman Finkelstein, although Finkelstein calls it the """"Dahiya strategy"""" in his book, This Time We Went Too Far, not mentioned previously here.This Time We Went Too Far, a book by Norman Finkelstein..

Besides the JPost, Haaretz, and Y-net links already mentioned, Al Jazeerah uses the phrase.Al Jazeerah op-ed by Stephen Lendman, 31 May 2010. The New York Times also uses it, and discusses its implications.Tough Military Stance Stirs Little Debate in Israel, by Isabel Kershner, 24 December 2009, The New York Times. ( Access to NYT articles via clickthrough from a google search may be necessary if given NYT links don't work for you.

                           For not even death can do our loved ones apart;
                           The ones who were dear, the ones who were a part
                           Of our happiness and grief, of our rise and fall,
                           They will be resurrected whenever we recall!
            What would you not do to restore to life the ones you have lost to death? I am not talking about voodoo or some black magic. I am talking about obituaries. These are small memoirs or biographical sketches of the deceased ones which are usually published in newspapers. These may also be in the form of a notice about an upcoming funeral or death anniversary, with details about the subject.

            Death is a loss that cannot be reimbursed, but it is inevitable and it is the truth of life. One cannot escape it. So mourning it will only increase the pain. Instead, by reliving the good old times and cherishing the best of the memories, we can make the distant souls rest in peace. 
            They might have left never to return, but their memories are there to linger. An obituary is the only way of paying reverence and expressing our affection for them, to preserve what is left of them, to make them immortal. 
The advent of technology has made it even easier to make our tribute through online obituary services. Life goes on and for those who have an overly busy schedule; these services have proven to be a boon.
             Ideated and founded by Mr. Rajith Rajappan and his colleague Ruhee Sabins, Oobituary.com is one such site that allows you to upload pictures, visuals, audios and videos to your page apart from the text. It is a platform where people from all over the world come together and share their feelings in the memory of their lost beloved. If you desire otherwise, you can also customize your page and make it accessible to only select friends and relatives and inform them by notify them by sending link to their email ids. After clicking on the link and signing up, they will be directed to your post, where they can comment. This page shall remain active till eternity unless you make a special request to delete your account.
              The best part is Mr. Rajappan has provided this service for free. Now go and bring your loved ones back to life only with a few clicks. Fill up the vacuum created by their absence with pleasant memories and smiles.",0,0

 Could there be another sub-section called """"International and comestic Reactions""""? 

I think it is pertinent to the article at this stage.

The Global Times (a Chinese daily apparently suffused with a glaring nationalistic view) article further said that while India's path for boosting its military strength has not met too many obstacles, the country is still poor (as if China is not) and lags behind in infrastructure construction (of course it does).

In Delhi, diplomatic sources in the Chinese embassy said, 

As a side note, India needs to take more consideration of external threats. And it seems naive to think that India can continue to develop as a global economic power without also bringing its defence capabilities up to the standards of other nations in the region. From our POV it seems poverty should be their priority, but the UK, US etc all have poverty and still spend billions on effective defence measures.

 Kahan recentism 

I just reverted an edit by Vgy7ujm for two reasons. First, the relevant article was only published 4 days ago, and so it is too recent for the rest of the academic community to have chewed it over and responded in any way. The articles in Wikipedia are not random newsfeeds of the latest events in each topic, but are encyclopedic summaries based mainly on secondary sources, that give a balanced overview of their subject. Primary research sources published in the last few days rarely make an article, and should never be used at the end of a section implying that they may represent the 'last word' on a subtopic. Secondly, the abstract of the referenced paper actually says that, by setting experimental subjects """"“science comprehension” tests"""", that it has detected """"the contamination of the science-communication environment with forms of cultural status competition"""". This is a long way from the much more even-handed coverage that Vgy7ujm gave it, by saying """"that global warming skeptics are as familiar with the relevant science as their opponents. They simply arrive at different conclusions."""" - as if this gives their antiscience views equal validity. I think we need to give things time, and if necessary, add a more balanced view of this research if, in time, it turns out to be notable.   """,0,0

It's because of the pan-Canadianist pretense that because BC is a province of Canada, it should have a bilingual name (why this is done for the Latin """"Nova Scotia"""" into French, when we don't say """"New Scotland"""" in English, is another matter); I agree with you and I think once-upon-a-time removed the French, but I guess it's back.  There's a certain lexical irony/injustice in the French translation, too, because the """"Columbia"""" part of the name comes from the river (via the fur district named after it), not the country (i.e. Columbia as the poetic name for the US, with nothing to do with Colombia except the shared namesake); the river got its name not from the poetic name of the US, but from Capt. Gray's ship The Columbia, which was the first to enter and sail up the river (so 'tis claimed); and the ship was named for the US, by way of its poetic name.  Confusing, huh?  Yeah, but the upshot is that in French the name of the river is la fleuve Columbia, but they insist that BC's name in French should be la colombie-brittanique i.e. from la colombie, which is the name for the South American country.

Equally, it is not acceptable for the other nutcase to keep trying to replace the psychoanalysts' carefully chosen word 'unpleasure' (frequently unconscious and often somatic and usually without any moralising or judgemental aspect) with the inadequate everyday and gentrifying literary word 'displeasure'. For the sake of ending this ignorant, vandalistic campaign as soon as possible, let me explain patiently that 'displeasure' is *connotatively different from* and *denotatively narrower than* 'unpleasure'  which is why psychoanalysis chose 'unpleasure' and the text-books continue to use it.

RP, good point - it does say """"team that reached the final"""" (so, presumably, the team that won the semi-final?) but it goes on to discuss the team and players that played in Seville. In any case, if this article is to be about Celtic's UEFA Cup campaign in 2002-2003, if that is notable enough for its own article, then it should be titled something like """"Celtic FC UEFA Cup campaign, 2002-2003"""" (though that is a pretty ugly title). There is apparently no consensus on what 'the Bhoys from Seville' means, and no discussion of the term and its meaning in secondary sources.

Hi, thanks very much for the clarifications; I'm beginning to see where I've been going astray.  Let me check one more thing, if you would be so kind.  If we attach a load of impedance ZS (which may be frequency dependent) across the secondary, then the equation

should hold, provided that the load is a linear system; these variables are the (complex) Fourier transforms of their time-domain counterparts such as IS(t) and VS(t).  

I'm asking this only because I think this is where I'm going astray; personally, I think that we should avoid complex quantities/phasors, at least in the initial sections for lay-people.  Transformers seem hard enough to understand without introducing complex voltages and currents; I suspect most people would feel confused by them.  Leibniz says that complex numbers are """"amphibians caught halfway between Being and Non-Being""""; do you measure an imaginary current with an imaginary meter? ;)

This section badly needs cleaning up. I am happy so to do but I should like to seek support, here, first. A prerequisite is that attendance at the school should be reliably sourced - no source must mean no inclusion. The second prerequisite is notability. A page is not needed to demonstrate notability but it helps! Looking at the red-links some have no claims to notability and for some the claims can be simply tested. Take Mike Pointing for example. If he has played in a competitive match for Harlequins first team then he meets WP:Athlete. If he has just played for their academy then he doesn't. If Michael Latham is an influential film-maker why doesn't he have a page? My view is that if an editor thinks that an alumnus is notable and feels strongly that they should be included in this list then write a stub! It is always quicker to write a stub than have a long debate trying to establish their notability separately.

To deal with this situation efficiently I am proposing that red-linked or unsourced people should be moved here. This preserves the information that we have about them and they can then be moved back to the article as sources are found or notability is demonstrated. Views, please.   

I'm with you, TerriersFan. Move the redlinks here or give a diff to the deletion; they can be added back when the burden of proof is met.   

I too agree with your suggestion. Thanks for taking this on.

Hello, and thank you for writing the article Junior Seau Beach Community Center and Bandshell. I have done a substantial rewrite, emphasizing the historic nature of the bandshell. With that in mind, and seeing that you are good at photography and posting photos, I wonder if you might want to take a picture of the bandshell (showing its lovely beach location) and load it into the article in the History section - depending on how the deletion discussion goes. You might also consider deleting the photo of Sanchez and Brown; some people seemed to think there was too much emphasis on minor elected officials. I already deleted the picture of the two councilmembers who voted against the project, viewing it as irrelevant to the article and contributing to clutter. 

BTW when you comment at an AfD deletion discussion, don't bold the first part of your comment unless it is an actual """"vote"""" such as delete, keep, or merge. Those bolded comments are taken as a kind of summary of people's positions and a way to quickly view how the discussion is going; in fact there are bots that summarize the discussion using those bolded """"votes"""", although the closing administrator takes into account the whole discussion rather than just tallying the """"votes. I took the liberty of removing the bolding from your """"merge and redirect"""" paragraph, since it was clear that you were not actually recommending a merge and redirect. You might want to add Keep to one of your comments to make it clear that is your opinion.   """,0,0

I did not say what you repeatedly say I said. You have several times now said I should be blocked for calling somebody a """"cunt"""". You have repeatedly made false accusations against me without a single time providing a diff. I am well aware of what I have written and where it was written. I have not called you or anybody else such a word anywhere on Wikipedia. The most outrageous thing in the diff in which you were blocked for was not your reference to """"cancer"""". It is your persistence in spreading false and malicious commentary about me. In that diff you say When Nableezy had the balls to say that he knew someone was a sockpuppet but that he was keeping his mouth shut because he likes him it showed that he was here for one reason and one reason only. Post a diff that backs that comment up. Just one, try to find one. Later on you say this time he called people cunts. Could you please provide a diff in which I call people (pl) cunts (pl) or even a person a cunt? Of course you cant, but that doesnt stop you. I dont even care if you are blocked or not, I wanted an admin to make you stop making these outrageous accusations without providing any evidence. Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was socking. You back out of it by saying """"Im not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do"""", as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence.The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I """"breed cancer"""", that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason NoCal or Dajudem socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or distorting it. Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, AfDs, ANI, AE, AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. This user has had their account """"vanished"""" to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So Dajudem began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a """"cunt"""" or retract the charge. Same for the accusation that I knowingly overlooked sockpuppetry because I liked a user. nableezy - """,1,1

 Mgnbar. What is a stupid act?? 

Hi  consensus means that every body must agree.
I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 
The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.The answer is Yes!For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.God luck with deleting all my contributions =) I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake.

 Terminology for this article 

Reading various Wikipedia articles, it's apparent that Wikipedia is as about as muddled in terminology as the literature is. I am clear on a concept, which Chandrasekhar calls """"specific intensity"""", which fully characterizes the radiation field in a medium, without physical surfaces.  is the energy passing thru an area element dA into a small solid angle  about the normal to the area element in a small frequency band  in a small time interval dt. It has SI units of watts/meter^2/sr/hz. Apparently many people refer to this as """"radiance"""". Can we please settle on a term for this concept, and use it consistently? 

Next is the question of a physical surface. What is the term that fully characterizes the radiation coming out of a physical surface element that corresponds to """"specific intensity"""", but is only specified for radiation out of the surface, and is undefined into the surface? It cannot have the same name, because its only like, half of the specific intensity. How do we describe the fact that this radiation is independent of direction, as long as that direction is out of the physical surface?

These are questions that need to be settled on before we can write a decent article. In my mind, I use the terms """"specific intensity"""" or """"spectral intensity"""" for the first paragraph above, and """"radiance"""" for the second, but I don't care what names are used, as long as they are precisely defined and a case can be made that it is a common definition.

Thanks, I found it at Amazon yesterday so thought I'd have a go at uploading it. I like what you've done with the quote. I think the background is the appropriate place to discuss the response to what Hedren claims. I'm not sure whether we need to include the Telegraph article in the criticism section now as it's mentioned earlier, so I'll take that bit out. You can always restore it if you don't agree though. Another thing we may need to add is some viewing figures for the film's US and UK television debuts. Finding them for the UK seems quite straightforward, but I can't seem to track them down for the US. If you can help with that it would be much appreciated. Cheers   13:26",0,0

What has the existence of a Battleground done to articles in this topic area, is really what I want to know.  While EE editors have apologized for some personal offenses, I believe that none of them have shown understanding that they harmed Wikipedia.

Except to be honest I feel a bit differently about the admin. Mostly I want support for the argument that the whole Battleground approach is inferior.  Evidence that shows damage done by all parties for what it is would help because the focus on the revelations from the list while ignoring the other half the battleground reinforces their feelings of persecution.  Right now each side exaggerates the damage done by the other and then there is extra evidence against EE from the list.

Heqwm, continuing to make edits against consensus is unhelpful.
Consensus?  What planet are you on?  There have been only two other editors commenting, and one seems to agree that other sources are required, and the other agrees that """"Wikipedia can't accept an editors own personal interpretation of the Bible"""".

I will not further address your points on civility. We're here to discuss issues, not people. At the same time, calling my responses """"ridiculous"""" sours the debate.
Ah, so you won't discuss civility... except to criticize me.  Posting ridiculous arguments is what sours the debate.  I can't have a discussion with you if you insist on making up new definitions for words, such as """"plain reading"""" meaning """"whatever I say it means"""" and """"opinion"""" meaning """"anything people disagree on"""".

I have not labeled your views in such a way and am carefully avoiding this.
So declaring your interpretation """"plain meaning"""" is not in any way conceited and a clear declaration that my position is without any merit?

I have """"cited the Bible like it directly says"""".
Did you even read what I wrote?  Your editing of my words indicate that you didn't even bother trying to understand what I'm saying.

I have explained why even on plain reading one is not forced to accept that """"ten commandments"""" there must refer to the ritual decalogue,

Grizzlygus1 - I believe criticism sections are almost always going to be inappropriate in Wikipedia. Just about everyone has somebody who disagrees with them about something. Some, like outspoken atheists, will have more than many from conservative religious parts of society who disagree. That's a given. We cannot possibly list all the criticism, so what's the point of listing any? We should just describe what's significant about someone (i.e. why they have an article here) and let others decide on the merits of their actions and views. The same goes for people significant for their strong religious views. List those views, and let it stand. Going any further will inevitably create the debate of """"how much further?""""

No, actually, we're not here for the same reason.  I don't have a lot of experience with Wikipedia, and I'm not here to do lots of work on Wikipedia, and I don't read their policies (would take too much time - not really interested - I'm an armchair reader/editor of Wikipedia).  What I find with Wikipedia these days, is, to find out some detail/meat on a subject, one has to go to the edits and look at stuff that has been deleted.  There seems to be a huge effort by people to delete stuff on subjects they know nothing about.  I just got through going around in circles with a guy (I think he was also a Wikipedia administrator) where he deleted all sorts of stuff from the bio of Anthony Senter (a convicted Lucchese/Gambino mobster doing life for multiple murders).  The whole bio was taken from a well-known book called """"Murder Machine"""" and it was referenced at the bottom under """"References"""", but this guy wanted everything deleted if it didn't have a citation at the end of each sentence.  I had to tell him that the entire article came from that one book (and it's a good book, written by a well-known NY crime reporter).  What the guy/administrator should have done is first known the subject matter then edit - that way, he would have known that the whole thing was in fact already referenced at the bottom.  I tried putting in a few links but I couldn't get them to work (somebody else fixed them).  It's really too much work to go around and around in circles with these guys (they seem to be """"busybodies"""") as they delete and delete and delete, when in fact the items are either (1) well known to anybody that knows the subject matter (like Conrad's friendship with Spilotro), or (2) they are very easily found.  The way you are running things here at Wikipedia, the only entries will be made by administrators like yourself who know Wikipedia's syntax, etc.  You will either not get edits from people like me, or, if you do, they will be deleted.

Hurricane Expert Reconsiders Global Warming Link

Prominent MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel has publicly reversed his view regarding global warming's alleged impact on hurricanes.

“The [computer] models are telling us something quite different from what nature seems to be telling us,"""" said Emanuel, whose views on hurricanes and global warming have been prominently cited by Al Gore and other promoters of climate change fear.

He told the New York Times. """"There are various interpretations possible: The big increase in hurricane power over the past 30 years or so may not have much to do with global warming, or the models are simply not faithfully reproducing what nature is doing. Hard to know which to believe yet.”

In 2005, a few weeks before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Emmanuel asserted in a paper that he had found statistical evidence linking rising hurricane energy and global warming.

His conversion is a very important new development in the climate debate, said Marc Morano, a top aide to climate change skeptic Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.

""""First, 2007 turned out to be the ‘tipping point’ for global warming fears, and 2008 appears to be the year of vindication for skeptics as many prominent scientists reverse their climate views, more and more skeptical scientists speak out, and new data debunks man-made climate fears.

“Now another major scientist reconsiders his views on a significant aspect of man-made climate fears.”

I will go as far to say any power self-identifying """"mulattos"""" have or hope to have will always be in relation to """"black"""" people.

Interestingly, people at the helm of the """"mulatto movement"""" more than likely turn out to be quadroons or octoroons. It's fascinating because there is a hierarchical paradigm that is followed; and what's funny is that I can imagine hexadecaroon's forming a """"quadroon movement"""" that not only denigrated """"black"""" people but """"mulatto"""" people as well.

 Article Name Change (PROTECTION OF PAGE AND VOTING) 
Calling the film """"Cloverfield (creature)"""" seems to indicate that the creature is actually named Cloverfield. Seeing that there is no cite that I have seen confirming this, and, just as well, the first sentence of the article notes that the being is """"unidentified,"""" I personally don't see why this article is named such. Shouldn't the article's title be changed? I think it should be called """"Cloverfield Monster,"""" without the parenthesis. Is this fact... 
Don't like """"Cloverfield Monster,"""" but I have been wondering if we shouldn't move it to something like """"Creature (Cloverfield)"""" or """"Monster (Cloverfield)"""".  Nither of those are particularly good, either.  The problem is that given that the thing doesn't appear to have any proper name, there's really no perfect place for the article to go right now.  Using a generic noun with (Cloverfield) after it seems to have the appropriate vagueness.  The producers tend to refer to it as 'creature', but most third-party sources are calling it a 'monster.'  We may as well flip a coin, really.  
I should also add that I don't hate where the article is now, either, though.  Like I said, naming an article on something that doesn't have a name is frustrating.    | Talk 
The movie's opening """"titles"""" say """"US DOD... Multiple sightings of case designate """"Cloverfield"""""""". Best we can go with. '  
I believe that refers to the case itself or the code name of the camera, not the monster.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 65.34.244.213   
This has already be discussed in previous sections of the talk.  It seems the general concensous is, no it isn't an ideal title, but since we have nothing better, there isn't sufficient motivation to move it.  """"Cloverfield monster"""" is certainly a likely candidate, but without an extremely reliable source, such as an official designation from the creative property holder, we may as well leave it where it is until such a source comes into existence.  A sequel looks rather undoubtable, and I should think chances are pretty good it will get a name within the fictional universe then. -  
I think """"Cloverfield (creature)"""" seems fine.  Hello all,
The citation provided in the intro which apparently backs up the (not so fact) fact of Matt Reeves stating it is the name of the creature is not mentioned in the citation at all. He only explains why it is the title of the movie, it was a codename named after a Paramount property which stuck with the project, There were other codenames such as Slusho and Bertha.

However my point is not this, but the fact that the name of the creature is not Cloverfield but in fact the name of the military operation assigned to tackle the creature, as the film stated itself """"Case designated Cloverfield"""", ha, not only this but the director itself has stated it is applied to the military operation, if you would be so kind to read the [2] citation in the intro I have provided. Hows that for an official designation from the creative property holder. Now good day to all, and this is why the article should be The Cloverfield creature. '  

I also question the quality of the source given, but that is discussed below.  I don't feel The Cloverfield creature is an appropriate title for this article either.  For one thing, there are two """"creatures"""" in cloverfield, the main creature, and the parasites, both of which are discussed in this article.  For another thing, it sounds too official.  """"The Cloverfield creature"""" is not it's official name either.  I think it is much better to just leave it as Cloverfield_(creature) and wait for more sources.  Eventually the creature will get a name, and at that point the page will just have to move again, so I'd like to see a stronger argument for why your name choice, or any other, is optimal and signifigantly better than it's original name. -[[Use",0,0

Editor Canderra argues that the sources below are blogs and has deleted the material.

Please take your time now to review the section and check the sources for yourself, lets see if they really are blogs.

New York Sun writer, Williams Myers, labels Che as a """"sociopathic thug"""". Other US newspaper critics have made similar remarks. They point out that Che Guevara was responsible for the torture and execution of hundreds of people in Cuban prisons, and the murder of many more peasants in the regions controlled or visited by his guerrilla forces. Contrary to Che supporters, these critics also argue that Che was a blundering tactician with no recorded combat victories. They claim that Che failed medical school in Argentina and that there is no evidence that he earned a medical degree.  They note that Che murdered individuals on dubious grounds and took their property, seized private manors for himself, and distributed property among communist bureaucrats rather than the peasants. The also state that he not only oversaw the prison, over which he ordered the execution of hundreds if not thousands of Cubans, but also helped institute forced labor camps when volunteerism failed. Finally, these critics believe that Che was a major failure at managing the Cuban economy as he """"oversaw the near-collapse of sugar production, the failure of industrialization, and the introduction of rationing—all this in what had been one of Latin America’s four most economically successful countries since before the Batista dictatorship."""",,

Some critics, such as Che-Mart, have merchandised their dislike of Che Guevara by marketing t-shirts poking fun at both Che Guevara and his supporters, for example, pointing out what they percieve as an irony: Che Guevara as one of capitalisms hotest selling images.

Stop adding so much unnecessary edits to the C train article. I don't know why you're going into more detail about the R32s. It's just a damn train. Nobody cares how often a train breaks down or whatever issues it has. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a Mean Distance Between Failures figure about how often any train break downs or whatever. Besides, the C train and the R32 car articles already mentions the breakdown rates anyway, just in a more subtle way. All it matters is just simply saying that the R32s were moved to outdoor lines to save their aging air compressors from having to work underground all the time. That's it. There's no need to mention what kind of issues the cars themselves have nor how they are/were solved. At least, in my book, your edits to the C train article were either completely over-opinionated, unsourced, or both, and thus, are not needed to mention. It's not like you work for the MTA anyway, so don't speculate about railcar maintenance, inspection or issues. If you don't work for the MTA and therefore, have no experience about the inner workings within the transit agency itself at all, by all means, stay silent, sit back, and relax.",0,0

The problem, precisely, is that if you assume that there is an underlying structure [noun] is raining [object], then from the very start you deny the possibility that the pronoun before the verb is in fact meaningless, i. e. a dummy word. If the pronoun refers to a noun and you can say what this noun is, then by definition it's not a dummy pronoun. My contention is that (maybe) the verb is really impersonal, i. e. its subject is truly a dummy word, not meant to mean anything but only appearing there to fill a syntactic slot.

The definition given at the start of the article is not sourced appropriately, I know; it just covers what I think are the features of what linguists call """"dummy pronoun"""", based on my amateur experience on the matter. I know it's not completely wrong or misleading, though it probably needs a different form. The glossary definition above, OTOH, is a bit too vague, but in any case, note that the very first example of dummy word given below in the source is the it in It is raining.""",0,0

Have you noticed that in every Wikibattle you enter you are on the opposite side of Jewish interests? Is this a coincidence? Do you notice that you put anti-semitic POV material into your commentary? Hmmm.... Why don't you stop abusing the Wikipedia.  It's an encyclopedia, not home to your bigoted nonsense.

His wife is algerian and she's the daughter of the president of the national

regime. He's indeed seen as the Polisario Algerian Man. He's also
involved in assassinating El Ouali when in mission in Mauritani in 1976.

El Ouali was quite outspoken and somehow independent from the Algerian
regime. It's Algeria that imposed him on polisario. He was never elected
or whatsover. No internal democracy. No separation of powers during his
rule. How can Wikipedia claim that he's pro liberalism and democracy ?

Yes Mr., this number add up to more than 100%. This is because most of the Ahmadis does not show up there identity as Ahmadis in Pakistan. Secondly I agree with Mr.. -Definition of Muslim upon which all Muslim scholars agree is """"Muslim"""" means a person who believes in the unity and oneness of Almighty Allah, in the absolute and unqualified finality of the Prophet hood of Muhammad, the last of the prophets, and does not believe in, or recognize as a prophet or religious reformer, any person who claimed to be a prophet in any sense of the word or of any description, whatsoever, after Muhammad. All suni/shia scholars agree on this definition. For more detail you can see the authenticated books of both sunni's and shia's, you will find same words. But Ahmadis call Mr.Ghulam Ahmad there Prophet as stated here: Prophethood (Ahmadiyya). Thats the reason they are not allowed to call themselves as Muslim. Other Muslim countries do not declared them non-Muslims but Pakistan because this movement was started in India/Pakistan. India do not declared them non-Muslim officially because India is not an Islamic country, but all Muslim scholars of India consider them as non-Muslims. Hope so it clarifies. Discuss © """,0,0

 freedom of speech
 not defended by Democrats. Democrats tend to jump on people who say offensive things, (offensive how, or to whom) is guess what.. the Democrats! They tend to jump on people who do not use what they consider to be the current politically correct lingo. People have lost their jobs because of this sort of thing. freedom of speech is a right. A God given right enforced in our Constitution.
 the right to bear arms.
 Obviously, the right to bear arms torn down by their own admission.Please see article page 'crime and gun control under Democrat Party Stances http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29

The right to from a militia and the right to bear arms Shall not be infringed This seems pretty clear and simple to me. The right to defend ourselves against tyranny.

Use a little common sense when using the linkfarms suggestion.  When there > 10 new spam entries per day and the links are hugh, linkfarm suggestion may make sense.

 Question about why you deleted my link 
I posted a link to www.justiceforkevin.org, a non-profit site with valuable information about a man who was wrongfully convicted of rape. You deleted my edit, saying I was a spammer. I respectfully disagree  this website would have saved Kevin's life if he had had the information it contains, and the makers of the site are dedicated to preventing this tragedy from happening to anyone else. It should be available for Wikipedia readers interested in these lagal issues. So how do I go about putting it back up  and maybe getting you to come down off of your high horse? —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 71.138.56.209  .
(see Special:Contributions/68.101.131.133). First off, don't add the same link to over 15 pages in 22 minutes. That looks really bad. Second, Wikipedia is not a collection of external links; while he may have been subject to Megan's law, there are many such people, and a link to every 'save so-and-so' page would dwarf the article. Finally, stay civil; insulting people is likely to make them more hostile to you.  (talk to me) 
OK, that's all well and good, but it's still within the Wikipedia rules. What does it matter how fast they were added, or that if EVERYONE did it, what would happen. I never insulted anyone, but you sure seem to have taken this all to your head, with deciding who should be included in these articles and who shouldn't. And if you are sensitive about people being rude to you, why delete their contributions? Are you doing it out of your hostile anger, or is it an actual appreciation for the rules? Seems like the former based on your response. Again, this link is a perfectly acceptable addition to the sites it was posted on  both because of subject matter and pursuant to Wikipedia rules. I am going to repost them, and if they get deleted again because of your opinion, then I'll report it to Wikipedia myself.—The preceding unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs).
'Get off your high horse' seems like an insult to me. And I'm not sensitive at all; I've been called far worse things without batting an eye. I just don't like it is all, and people have easily been blocked for doing similar things before. Besides, I'm being anything but hostile right now. I'm trying to work this out with you. And if you repost, I will block you again. If you want to complain about me, you can do it at the administrator's noticeboard, or request a 3rd opinion, or go to the mediation cabal, or bring it up on the talk page for the Wikipedia counterspam effort; this is probably the closest thing to 'reporting it to Wikipedia'. And the external link guidelines say that links whose subject is not directly related. There are many people who other people believe were wrongfully convicted of rape; why is this man (and not John Doe) special?  (talk to me) 

Oooh, so THAT's what it's about ... I have to prove to you that something is """"special"""" and get you to approve it first? This is a public website, and you're being way too controlling with this.

I would find it odd, but nothing on Wikipedia surprises me that while the whole Duke nonrape was about people being “falsely accused”, Duke53 , W and others are more than willing to “falsely accuse” Crystal of being a liar. 

If you have any evidence that she is a liar, I suggest you go to the NCDA. Likewise, I may have a theory that many of the people here are liars, but I give the benefit of the doubt that they are “mistaken” and if were being checked into the mental hospital – I would give the possibility of crazy/delusional. 

Passive voice English lesson for the average teenager Wikipedian:

Iraq was falsely accused of having weapons of mass destruction. = true 

Bush HONESTLY accused Iraq of….., but Bush was mistaken.  = true if Bush thought it was TRUE

Bush FASLELY accused Iraq of…  = false if Bush thought it was True

Problems in the household ended or so it would seem with his mother losing the rights to all nine of her children. “BIG HITZ” then lived in foster homes, orphanages, and group homes for about five years before a family he was staying with took him in. “BIG HITZ”, 13 at the time was happy but his new family loved government money more than they loved him and when it came to his music “Hip Hop-Rap”, the family that took him in didn’t want him listening to “Hip Hop-Rap” or writing it. But “BIG HITZ” had his first taste of “Hip Hop-Rap” by listening to a rap group called Bone Thugs N Harmony and later, another rapper named Nas. “Big Hitz” had been writing since the early age of 13, and by the time he was 14 years old, he took his first step into a studio to do his first song called “ I represent”. Having a “Hard Knock Life” and hitting a rock bottom couldn’t stop “BIG HITZ” from writing and pursuing the American dream. Through writing and doing music, he found sanity in all of the madness that was going on in his life. At the age of 19, “BIG HITZ” moved in with a friend from High school and formed a group called “BASS & TREBLE” After successfully putting together a Record called “ THE BASS & TREBLE 7 HITZ ep. “BIG HITZ” had a huge sense of accomplishment but the Record went nowhere. After splitting with his friend and partner, “BIG HITZ” set out to build a strong solo career. After recording a solid demo and song catalog, “BIG HITZ” decided to move from Michigan to California.living in michigan brings you to present day. Written By Gisele S. Uwitonze'Bold text'",0,0

Matt Sanchez

There are several points in the current article that are designed to distort who I am or my work.  The lede says I'm an """"embed on assignment in Iraq"""".  I've spent just as much time in Iraq.   I'm not nor have I ever been a blogger.  I've never """"blogged"""" and yet the article claims blogging and commentary citing my participation in Fox Forums.  The truth is that I've written far more hard news for Foxnews.com and have only participated in Fox Forum when requested to by the editor.  The current focus of the article on blogging is meant to minimize my credentials as a reporter.  I'm also likened to Rich Merritt and Jeff Gannon.  Two comparisons that are meant to smear me and are also awkwardly placed in the article

You said that I should not be drawn into petty disputes but these issues have been in the article for two years and despite many protests no one has even bothered to answer why or how these comments have been put into the article.  Could you ask for some explanation or move to have the wording replaced?  Also, there was an image of Ann Coulter and myself in the article and it was removed.

Jayjg, is there any edit to this article you would accept? What are your objections to clarifying ethnic vs. religious definitions of """"Jews""""? The article is currently confusing as to which is which, and it would help to clarify that JfJ means ethnic Jews. I think in the case Mackan points out, """"many"""" is appropriately used-many Jewish groups do see JfJ that way, but certainly not all (I would imagine there are plenty of Jewish groups without any official position on JfJ.) Also, most religions are rather fluid and change over time, and there is often debate over interpretation. It is, therefore, not quite so easy to state religious principles as fact (Jews don't believe in Jesus as Messiah? What about Messianic Judaism?) Of course, religious faith also tends to be given over to a lot of dogmatism (""""my way is the correct one"""" type of thinking), so sometimes it's difficult to see debates to that as valid. WP:WEASEL does not object to ever using """"many"""" or """"most"""" or the like as qualifiers, it advocates against it only in the absence of sourcing. What we have here is a lot of sourcing, which does not, however, show that all Jews object to JfJ (as I explained above, that would be effectively impossible). It does, of course, show that """"many"""" do (I wouldn't even object to """"almost all"""" or """"most""""), but in order to preserve the plausibility requirement of WP:NPOV (JfJ's assertion that it is Jewish must be treated as plausible), it is impossible that all Jewish organizations disagree-as JfJ doesn't!

See revert 1 and 4 compared.  http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Che_Guevara&diff;=39908363&oldid;=39772586

Canderra's claims are idiotic at best.  I am not surprised that the leftists don't care as they have shown no dicipline for allowing information contrary to their own beliefs.  Even the most insane excuses are accepted by them.

Saying these this behavior is idiotic or stupid is reasonable given the fact that this material is deleted because Canderra believes the sources to be blogs.  Not one source is a blog.  The New York Sun, USA Today, Frontpage Magazine, Florida International University, History News Network, and the Independent Research Institute...ARE NOT BLOGS.

I have repeatedly expressed the opinion that the most idiotic, as opposed to merely lazy, thing that Tyson has been revealed to have done was to listen to Bush's Biblical quotation and write a note to himself (which in the event he was too lazy to locate) to the effect, apparently, that Bush had clowned himself by taking credit for star names that were actually Arabic. So, since I wrote the words you complain about, it should be obvious that they are not intended to make Tyson seem in any way correct. I would be in favor of making this clearer by quoting someone to the effect that attributing to Isaiah the intent to take credit for star charts drawn up a millennia after Isaiah's death is profoundly stupid, but I was in a hurry to replace a vacancy on the page and an appropriate source didn't spring to mind. In any case, I am adamantly opposed to the change you propose, since it removes all specifics, leaving a tasteless gruel, and I don't see anything particularly """"encyclopedic"""" about bad writing.

 Song move 

You gave me some good advice about moving and redirecting pages. Thank you.

Unfortunately, I made a real mess when I tried to move """"Let It Snow"""" to """"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!""""  When I did the redirect, I accidentally mistyped the title as """"Let It Snow! Let It Snoe! Let It Snow!"""" (notice the """"Snoe"""") and forgot to look before I leapt. If that wasn't bad enough, I then went to the Redirect page for """"Let It Snow"""" and, instead of leaving the misspelling alone, I changed it to redirect to """"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!"""" (the correct spelling), thus creating that page, which did not previously exist. Thus, when I tried to change the misspelled name to the correct name, I of course got the error that the other page already exists.  

Not to mention that there were some double redirects when I looked in """"What links here,"""" which I was going to start to fix until I realized how badly I messed up the original move. (It turns out that someone had renamed the page in 2005, with no discussion, from """"Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow"""" to """"Let It Snow,"""" a move I would have vehemently protested if I'd been hanging around here at the time.) 

I need some help to undo this. The simplest thing would be to delete the current """"redirect"""" page for the correct title and resume from there, renaming my misspelled page and then looking at the redirects again, but I can't delete pages, and I know the rules about cutting and pasting.  """,0,0

There once was a little boy named Johnny who had a wonderful dog named Laddie.  Johnny was prone to emotional outbursts, and his mother was concerned by his overreactions. One day while Johnny was at school, Laddie was killed in an unfortunate accident. The mother took Laddie's body and put it in the backyard. She was very worried how Johnny would react to the news of his dog's death. When Johnny returned from school, his mother said to him, """"I'm really sorry, Johnny, but Laddie died in an accident."""" Johnny responded """"Okay"""" and went upstairs to change his clothers. The mother was quite surprised at the calm reaction. After Johnny put on his play clothes, he went out to the backyard. All of a sudden, the mother heard Johnny screaming. She rushed out to the backyard and saw Johnny prostrate over the dog's body and wailing. The mother said, """"But, Johnny, I told you Laddie died."""" In between sobs, Johnny sputtered, """"I thought you said Daddy.""""

Not being used to Wiki process I didn't see the warning until after it was made although I'm not sure what that difference would have made long term. The notion of fascism in respect of the operation of wiki is not meant as an insult but describes a particular way of operating a nation, organisation etc. Having spent many years dealing with institutional abuse of authority etc. the """"harassment"""" of my contribution was corporate, but for those very reasons it will not be a productive line of enquiry. I suppose I could also turn to a zealous enforcement of the rules and seek wiki awards. 
Anyway in respect of my request we're now leaving wiki territory in terms of copyright and going where statutory law applies. Can you point me in the direction of an administrator or agent of wiki that can deal with this issue knowledgeabley? I haven't assigned copyright to wiki and wiki policy can't supersede law. I suppose I could formally assign copyright of all those images to a third party which would immediately create a wiki violation.
I'd also be interested in views about the difference between self-interest in requiring attribution and that notion in respect of links. It's a mark (and again this is a valid view) of paternalistic and authoritarian operations no matter how benign to operate arbitrarily without explanation.

Agreed.  That area of the table needs some work, and is not fully consistent on the distinction.  It came about because """"scheduled"""" (which was formerly the word used in all future launches) was both clearly incorrect and also unsourced for many of the rows in the table.  

When I looked at a bunch of the sources about a month ago (2015-02-14), for most of the far future launches, the most one could say is that they were """"under contract""""; while some of the very near term future launches (one to three ahead in the queue) were both clearly """"scheduled"""" and also scheduled with the particular local and national authorities to make the near term date have some meaning.  So that is what led to my attempt to improve the article by having a three-way distinction: 
 """"Scheduled (with range & launch license authorities)""""

I figured the list should not be removed per se (someone may well actually want a list like that from wikipedia) but its ugly and bulky and shouldn't be in the main article. So I put it in a separate article, Circumcision worldwide. Couldn't think of a better name for now. Maybe make it an actual list:circumcising countries eventually?

 The phonology of Urdu appears to be different enough from that of Hindi because of (however artificial) phonemes not, for instance, present in Hindi as they are of Persian derivation.

 """"Ants evolved..."""" as a statement of fact. 

I was wondering if we could have some references inserted after the second sentence of this article:
""""Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the mid-Cretaceous period between 110 and 130 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants.""""
Also, perhaps this statement should begin with the words """"Many experts believe..."""" or """"Evidence suggests..."""" etc. etc. rather than making a statement of fact since this is not an established fact.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 62.6.149.18   
 This brings up a good point that many things are stated as fact when it comes to science.  I think that people are only careful to state things the way you describe for things that haven't been statistically proven, which points out several flaws in the statement.  Evolution is well enough established as well as ants evolving from wasps, but them first appearing the the mid-Cretaceous period is hard to statistically prove.  I suppose this should be changed if I'm right, but I may not be.   ~talk 
The Cretaceous period is not a short duration even on an evolutionary scale. The sentence might appear precise if used with some small unit of time but putting it at somewhere between 110 to 130 million years is not exactly being very precise nor does it appear to be an arrogant statement of the available evidence.   
Very true.   ~talk 

 ants 

where do ants mate.
how long do they live.
do they have sex.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.7.207.156   

heh, viable question.  This spawned me to look over the reproduction part of the page and I did some rewriting.  It should be double-checked for good measure.  The article answers these well enough.  Ant's live varied amounts of time depending on many things.  Some workers only live a few months while some queens have been recorded to live more that 30 years.   ~talk 

 Common ants varieties 

There is almost no mention of Little Black Ants or Red Ants in this article. I see these ants everywhere and think that there should be more mention of them.
I'm not sure where you are but if it's Europe then those guys are probably Lasius niger and Myrmica rubra. They aren't common everywhere. '''[[User:Sean.hoyland|",0,0

Now here's some PHILOSOPHY (it seems there's no alternative User:Quiddity but to shout it:
   """"The history of philosophy is punctuated
   by revolts against the practices of previous
   philosophers and by attempts to transform 
   philosophy into a science—a discipline in 
   which universally recognized decision-
   procedures are available for testing phil-
   osophical theses.  In Descartes, in Kant, in
   Hegel, in Husserl, in Wittgenstein’s Trac-
   tatus, and again in Wittgenstein’s Phil-
   osophical Investigations, one finds the same
   disgust at the spectacle of philosophers 
   quarreling endlessly over the same issues.  
   The proposed remedy for this situation 
   typically consists in adopting a new 
   method: for example, the method of  “clear
   and distinct ideas” outlined in Descartes’
   Regulae, Kant’s “transcendental method,”
   Husserl’s “bracketing,” the early Wittgen-
   stein’s attempt to exhibit the meaningless-
   ness of traditional philosophical theses by 
   due attention to logical form, and the later
   Wittgenstein’s attempt to exhibit the point-

c02eb307557cb071,"Antonio Diego Voci 

Hello, you placed the critique of “too many pictures” at the top of the Antonio Diego Voci page and suggested I review “Manual Style on Images” I had already used that guide to originally construct the Antonio Diego Voci page.  I have just refreshed myself as suggested.
 
1.      Comparison to the Wikipedia recommended “Timpani” revised page finds the Antonio Diego Voci page to be similar in both layout and ratio of images to text, and thus is in compliance. 
2.      One item I overlooked and in good faith will now correct is the caricature of Diego’s father-in-law so that he is looking toward the text and not away from it, and thus be in compliance.
3.      The images within the text are all relevant to specific items in the text, located together as close as the system allows and thus are in compliance.
4.      Since I could not find any Wikipedia specific numbers for quantity of images to include in the gallery, I used as my guide other notable artists with pages which Wikipedia suggested.  I found that the Cezanne Gallery had a similar number, Renoir had several more, and Monet had twice as many; therefore again by comparison of numbers are in compliance.
 
NOTE: Relating to the Gallery, Diego was highly accomplished in several genres.  I culled from hundreds of image choices to illustrate Diego’s versatility identified by Genre: Works, Faces, Surrealism, Cubism, Clowns/Harlequins/Musicians, Landscapes, and Horses/Boats.  I wanted to add Fauvism, Figures and Abstract but, decided to err on the conservative side for total numbers of images.
 
5.      Lastly, to show my good faith to the conscientious editor, I eliminating 5 images from the body of the text.  Removed is one of the 2 Native Indian images.  And somewhat reluctantly, 4 images of official government documents which I felt added credibility.  They will now be found scanned documents.
 
In closing, compliance with Wikipedia has been and IS my objective for the Antonio Diego Voci page.  Maintaining the highest integrity, accuracy and visual appeal is vital to both Wikipedia and the reputation of Antonio Diego Voci.

This is a new concept to us in Karnataka. Branding every topic in South India as Dravidian is utterly wrong. I had mentioned in the """"vote"""" section for the article itself, that if this article is allowed to go thru, Wiki Raja will be dropping templates in every South India topic. This is not right.

 Reliability of U2gigs.com 

I know that there's been discussion of the reliability of U2gigs.com, but I just came across 2 print sources where the site is referenced.  The first is the 2009 book U2: A Musical Biography.  I don't have a copy of the book but a search at Google Books shows that the site is mentioned in the book.  The second is at the very bottom of the page in a 2007 issue of Billboard in a brief article about the songs played on the Vertigo Tour (link).  It's cited as u2-vertigo-tour.com (which, as your probably know, is the old url of U2gigs.com and typing it in will redirect you to the new site).  I actually just referenced this article from Billboard for the """"Streets"""" article, but it seems pretty redundant since I might have well have cited the website directly. Elevation-tour.com is cited in the book U2 Live: A Concert Documentary, and according to U2gigs' FAQ, Elevation-tour.com uses their database.  Let me know your thoughts. –  """,0,0

Also, my short foray into WP editing has evidenced that WP is no place to offer psychological knowledge that does not stick, prima facie,  to Newtonian physics; here, psychological knowledge must stick to the classical world like peanut butter does to bread. Let us leave these juvenile retarders of scientifically appraised and communicated findings another decade of their Punch-and-Judy approach to public communication of scientific knowledge. Science will progress, as always, without the contribution of such self-appointed protectors of self-obvious truths, and such puppets of the mythical fundamentals of human knowledge. Rodgarton",0,0

Lucky, I am totally understanding of what you are meaning now.
I'm having a great weekend few days too!  I'm going to take a break from the writing articles for the weekend and just concenntrate on the reading and learning part of wikimedia for now.  Plus though can you believe what  this bitter guy left on my talk page he helped me with a few things when I was really new and I voted for him as and Administrator (Like we talked about) and now lookk at this:

Brah, if you had read here, you would know that I am not an admin. Had I been nominated by a respectable person (not you), I would have stood a much better chance. Thanks for informing me of your true intentions in doing so. Just to set the record straight, I would have never come to the aid of a troll such as you, admin or otherwise. Please do not bother me again. ⇝⇝Talk

 Mitsubishi GTO 

I'm not sure where you got the idea that a 428×257 jpeg has """"sufficient size for wikipedia"""". It's 72kB. The photo you removed was 1515×856, and 270kB. The thumbnails may be te smae size, the full images themselves are most definitely not. We don't, as a matter of course, remove good images and replace them with inferior ones. The subject of the article is the 3000GT/GTO, not specifically the turbo, which was outsold 2:1 by the normally aspirated versions anyway.

It also more closely met the standards recommended at Wikipedia:WikiProject Automobiles/Conventions#Images, specifically #6 (""""The quality of an image is always more important than the quantity of images included"""") and #10 (""""Pictures for the infobox should depict the front ¾ view from the height of an ordinary person"""", bold text mine).
